OF APPEAL FOR BRITISH COLUMBIA Citation: Gichuru v. Vancouver Swing Society, 2020 BCCA 40 Date: 20200124 Docket: CA46012 Between: Mokua Gichuru Appellant (Petitioner) And Vancouver Swing Society, Matthew Lam, Kaitlin Russell, Angelena Weddell and The BC Human Rights Tribunal Respondents (Respondents) Before: The Honourable Madam Justice Saunders The Honourable Mr. Justice Fitch The Honourable Mr. Justice Butler On an application to vary: An order of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia, dated October 25, 2019 ( Gichuru v. Vancouver Swing Society , Vancouver Docket CA46012). Oral Reasons for Judgment Appearing as agent for the Appellant: G. Kimani Counsel for the Respondents, Vancouver Swing Society, Matthew Lam, Kaitlin Russell and Angelena Weddell: G. Henry Place and Date of Hearing: Vancouver, British Columbia January 24, 2020 Place and Date of Judgment: Vancouver, British Columbia January 24, 2020 Summary: The appellant’s application to vary an order he post security for costs is allowed only to the extent of extending the time for doing so, and setting aside the order he pay costs of the application for security for costs in any event of the cause. Comment on denial of request to hear the application by telephone because the applicant is in a foreign jurisdiction. [1] SAUNDERS J.A. : By order of Madam Justice Dickson made October 25, 2019, the appellant, Mr. Gichuru, was ordered to post security for costs of his appeal in the amount of $7,000 by December 31, 2019, pending which the appeal is stayed, with liberty to the respondents to apply to dismiss the appeal in the event the monies are not posted in the time provided. [2] Mr. Gichuru applies to vary that order pursuant to s. 9(6) of the Court of Appeal Act , R.S.B.C. 1996, c. 77 . [3] As a preliminary matter, I will record that on Friday, January 17, 2020, we received a letter from Mr. Gichuru explaining (as he had to the single justice) that he is currently resident in Korea and unable to attend today. He asked that we hear him by telephone, and provided what he said was his telephone number in Korea. Mr. Gichuru made a similar request of the justice hearing the security for costs application in October. We declined that request, as had the justice hearing the application in October. Such a procedure is neither effective nor efficient, and erroneously puts the onus on the court in respect to matters outside our jurisdiction. Generally speaking, it is not a practice we would adopt. We did agree, however, that Mr. Gichuru could have an agent attend on his behalf today, and today Ms. Kimani helpfully attended and presented orally a statement authored by Mr. Gichuru. [4] With that explanation, I turn to the application before us. It is well established that an application to vary an order of a single justice is not a rehearing of the original application: the approach a division of the court will bring to the matter is highly deferential and it is not enough to allege that the justice erred in the exercise of discretion. The court may interfere with the order of a single justice if there has been an error in principle, the justice was wrong in the legal sense, the justice misconceived the facts, or relevant information was not brought to the justice’s attention: DeFehr v. DeFehr , 2002 BCCA 139; Haldorson v. Coquitlam (City) , 2000 BCCA 672. [5] In this case, the application before the justice was for an order Mr. Gichuru post security for costs. That application fell to be decided on consideration of the four factors discussed by Mr. Justice Lowry in the case referred to by the justice, Creative Salmon Company Ltd. v. Staniford , 2007 BCCA 285: 1. the appellant’s financial means; 2. the merits of the appeal; 3. the timeliness of the application; and 4. whether the costs will be readily recoverable. [6] In his application to vary, Mr. Gichuru does not say the justice recited the incorrect factors, but says instead that she erred in her assessment of those factors. In particular he contends the justice erred in: 1) failing to give pre-eminent weight to the respondents’ tardiness in filing their application (I note that that complaint is strengthened and repeated today in the statement read by Ms. Kimani); 2) determining the appeal “lacks obvious merit”; 3) referring to comments of Madam Justice Garson in Gichuru v. Pallai, 2018 BCCA 78, to the effect that he had paid numerous court fees in pursuing a series of actions over the past decade; 4) failing to limit the order to costs incurred after the date of the application, 5) establishing the deadline for posting the security; and 6) ordering costs in favour of the respondents in any event of the cause. [7] Mr. Gichuru also complains that he was denied an adjournment of the hearing in October 2019, and that the justice failed to accommodate the difficulties he was encountering in pursuing this matter while a resident of a foreign country. [8] In the statement read today, Mr. Gichuru referred us to the recent decision of a single justice, Jacques v. Muir , 2019 BCCA 456, in which Mr. Justice Groberman declined to order security for costs because the application was brought after filings were compete, saying: “This Court has generally refused late applications for security for costs.” [9] Justice Dickson described the circumstances of the appeal and the application in this fashion: [3] The application concerns the British Columbia Human Rights Tribunal’s (“HRT”) refusal to accept a complaint of Mr. Gichuru’s for filing. Mr. Gichuru unsuccessfully sought reconsideration of this decision and then judicial review. He now appeals the dismissal of his judicial review application (indexed at Gichuru v. Vancouver Swing Society , 2019 BCSC 402). [4] Mr. Gichuru complained that VSS discriminated against him on the basis of age, sex and race and, in particular, for being an older black male. The chambers judge summarized the dispute as follows: [11] ... the crux of Mr. Gichuru’s complaint to the Tribunal involved what can be described as a dispute on Facebook over Mr. Gichuru’s conduct related to other female members of the VSS. Mr. Gichuru felt as if he had been harassed on Facebook by female members of the VSS and raised the issue with Ms. Wendell and Mr. Lam. It is clear that Mr. Gichuru expected the VSS executive to take his side on the issue, but they did not. Ultimately, the VSS executive asked other members of the VSS for input on Mr. Gichuru’s behavior and determined that it was his behavior that was problematic, although this was not known to Mr. Gichuru at the time. In response, Mr. Lam agreed to meet with Mr. Gichuru and provided him with three documents: a Facebook post written from the perspective of an older man in the swing community about older men crossing lines with younger women with romantic pursuits; a document on “Emotional Labour”, which included sections discussing “toxic masculinity”; and an article titled “How To Not Be Creepy”, which Mr. Lam recognized as having an inflammatory title in his email. [5] On March 21, 2019, the judge held that the HRT had jurisdiction to screen the complaint and found the decisions in question were not patently unreasonable. [6] Mr. Gichuru filed a notice of appeal on April 11, 2019. Although he has not filed any affidavit material in response to the security for costs application, in his written submission filed yesterday he asserts that VSS indicated an intention to apply for an order for security for costs. However, they did not do so until September 23, 2019, when they brought this application. By that time, the materials for the appeal had already been filed by all parties. VSS offered no explanation for the delay. In his written submission, Mr. Gichuru asserts that he spent approximately 100 hours on the appeal between April 18, 2019 and September 23, 2019. [10] In my view, none of the submissions advanced by Mr. Gichuru provide a basis upon which we can or should interfere with the order for security for costs. I would give him some relief, however, on the deadline for posting the security for costs, and on the order for costs of the application. [11] I address first Mr. Gichuru’s submissions concerning the court process. I have reviewed the file material carefully and see no basis for complaint. Mr. Gichuru has had the ability to communicate with this court electronically and has done so, and he has been accorded the opportunity to have an agent appear on his behalf, including today. Just as we have had the opportunity to review the file materials, so, too, the justice hearing the security for costs application had materials before her and referred to them in her decision. In particular, I would reject, as I have explained above, the proposition that Mr. Gichuru was entitled to the telephone attendances that he proposed. [12] I turn now to the criteria for the order that Mr. Gichuru seeks to vary, starting with the merits factor. Mr. Gichuru contends that the justice mis-assessed the merits of the appeal. He says that the reasons of the Human Rights Tribunal wrongly treated his complaint as one the Tribunal could decline to file, but it was not open to the Tribunal to decline to file a complaint after the 2002 amendments to the Human Rights Code , R.S.B.C. 1996, c. 210. He says Mr. Justice Masuhara erred when he found otherwise. [13] I see no error in the justice’s assessment of the merits of the appeal. Justice Masuhara found that s. 27 of the Human Rights Code gave the Human Rights Tribunal jurisdiction to dismiss an appeal summarily and said, after reviewing the substance of the Tribunal’s decision: “this is what happened here … the complaint did not allege an act or omission that contravened the Code ”. He referred to the language of the Tribunal’s decision of refusing to file the complaint as an artifact of the previous legislation and said “but it is clear upon close evaluation of the statutory regime that the Tribunal had the authority to dismiss his complaint for the reasons given.” That authority is found in s. 21, not s. 27. I see no real prospect that a division of this court would interfere with the substance of the conclusion that the Tribunal had the jurisdiction required to do as it did. In sum, I find no basis to interfere with the justice’s conclusion that the appeal lacks obvious merit. [14] Nor do I see error in her evaluation of Mr. Gichuru’s financial circumstances, or that the respondents, if successful on appeal, will be unlikely to readily recover costs that may be ordered in their favour. The justice observed that a search of Mr. Gichuru’s history of initiating actions resulted in 84 reported judgments on CanLII. That level of court activity demonstrates that Mr. Gichuru has been able to pay numerous court fees in pursing actions over the years. The justice observed that she had no evidence before her that Mr. Gichuru would be unable to pursue his appeal were he required to post the security for costs. While he makes that submission, the submission is unsupported by the record. [15] On the other hand, there was evidence before the justice that Mr. Gichuru does not own real property in British Columbia and he is currently living in a foreign jurisdiction. Mr. Gichuru himself did not depose to having exigible assets in this jurisdiction, and he concedes in fact in his written argument at para. 48: 48. Nevertheless, and in the alternative, the application should have been rejected on the basis that although the respondents’ chances of recovering their costs in the event they are successful on the appeal is doubtful , appellants who are without the financial ability to post security should not be precluded from pursuing a meritorious appeal for that reason alone. [Emphasis added.] [16] It was open to the justice to conclude that the respondents would have difficulty in recovering payment on an order in their favour for payment of costs of the appeal. One cannot say the justice erred in her application of the financial considerations. [17] All of this left the issue of the timeliness of the application which was, as the justice recognized, the only factor weighing against the respondents’ application. While timeliness is, generally speaking, important, it is not an invariable rule that an application brought after all the necessary filings have been made will be denied. It is, in the end, always an exercise of discretion taking all the circumstances into account. What is required of the justice is consideration of the entire picture. I conclude the justice here based her decision that security for costs should be posted on the entire circumstances before her, as she was required to do. Although we are referred to Jacques , that case does not reflect the difficult financial circumstances of the respondent arising from this litigation noted by Justice Dickson in her para. 23 of the reasons for the order that is sought to be varied: [23] [Vancouver Swing Society] is a small non-profit society, its resources have been exhausted by this litigation, and its directors have had to pay out‑of-pocket to continue defending themselves in this litigation. This factor weighs further in favour of a security for costs order. [18] I see no basis upon which we can, properly, interfere with that decision. [19] Nor do I see a basis upon which to say the justice was required to limit the amount posted to costs going forward as Mr. Gichuru now proposes. While that was one alternative available to her, it was not presented to her, and she cannot be faulted for declining to reduce the amount sought to be posted as security. [20] This leaves the time established by the order for the posting of security for costs, and the order for costs of the application to the respondents. The justice directed that the security for costs be posted by December 31, 2019. That date has come and gone. This application to vary the order was filed within time, but the reasons of the justice were not available to Mr. Gichuru for some time and I cannot see how Mr. Gichuru could have had this application heard by a division by the deadline of December 31, 2019 in all the circumstances. I consider it is appropriate to allow Mr. Gichuru some further time to file the security for costs. I would extend the time for filing security for costs to February 28, 2020. [21] The final question is the order for costs of the application before the justice. The usual order is that costs are in the cause. While I consider the appeal to be one of dim merit, that result is not a total foregone conclusion. There is, in my view, no reason that the respondents should be entitled to costs of the application in the event Mr. Gichuru’s appeal is successful. [22] I would allow the application to vary only to the limited extent of extending the time for Mr. Gichuru’s compliance with the order to post security for costs to February 28, 2020, and setting aside the order for costs of the application before Justice Dickson in favour of the respondents. [23] FITCH J.A. : I agree. [24] BUTLER J.A. : I agree. [25] SAUNDERS J.A. : The application to vary is allowed to the extent the time for posting the security for costs is now February 28, 2020. The order made by Justice Dickson for costs of that application in favour of the respondents is set aside. “The Honourable Madam Justice Saunders”"},"meta":{},"created_at":"2022-03-02T17:19:05.435924Z","updated_at":"2022-03-07T23:01:45.988468Z","project":1},{"id":4,"annotations":[{"id":10,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"start":3,"end":40,"text":"THE SUPREME COURT OF BRITISH COLUMBIA","labels":["COURT_NAME"]},"id":"A5WkXcQJTJ","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":141,"end":153,"text":"Nicolas Dunn","labels":["PERS_APPELLANT"]},"id":"pnXzhXu3Zs","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":158,"end":199,"text":"Her Majesty The Queen In Right Of Alberta","labels":["PERS_APPELLANT"]},"id":"yBlEiFvZkB","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":215,"end":232,"text":"Ernest Alan Heise","labels":["PERS_RESPONDENT"]},"id":"n_L1P79J3A","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":234,"end":251,"text":"Add Capital Corp.","labels":["PERS_RESPONDENT"]},"id":"hJnVC7UtZ0","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":253,"end":276,"text":"Legendery Holdings Inc.","labels":["PERS_RESPONDENT"]},"id":"efQjjkAfwT","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":278,"end":305,"text":"National Leasing Group Inc.","labels":["PERS_RESPONDENT"]},"id":"EnwWD-Fi_V","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":311,"end":343,"text":"Hope Truck & Trailer Repair Ltd.","labels":["PERS_RESPONDENT"]},"id":"WoQ6LYAuCS","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":363,"end":400,"text":"The Honourable Madam Justice Matthews","labels":["PERS_JUDGE"]},"id":"dHBZovEsdm","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":490,"end":501,"text":"G.

Heise, 2021 BCSC 1209 Date: 20210108 Docket: M184390 Registry: Vancouver Between: Nicolas Dunn and Her Majesty The Queen In Right Of Alberta Plaintiffs And Ernest Alan Heise, Add Capital Corp., Legendery Holdings Inc., National Leasing Group Inc., and Hope Truck & Trailer Repair Ltd. Defendants Before: The Honourable Madam Justice Matthews Oral Reasons for Judgment – Evidence of Dr. Rose Counsel for the Plaintiff Nicolas Dunn: G. Battista, Q.C. A. Paladeau Counsel for the Defendants: C.R. Fister K.A. Buecker Place and Dates of Trial\/Hearing: Vancouver, B.C. January 4-6, 2021 Place and Date of Judgment: Vancouver, B.C. January 8, 2021 [1] During this trial for damages arising from a motor vehicle accident, the plaintiff seeks to have his treating psychologist, Dr. Kris Rose, testify. The plaintiff has not served an expert report in accordance with the Supreme Court Civil Rules . The plaintiff has provided a will-say statement, which outlines the evidence that Dr. Rose is expected to give. [2] The defendants, Ernest Heise, Add Capital Corp., and Legendery Holdings Inc., object to portions of the anticipated evidence of Dr. Rose on the basis that it is expert evidence for which no notice nor report in accordance with the Rules has been delivered. The defendants National Leasing Group Inc. and Hope Truck & Trailer Repair Ltd. are not participating in this trial. [3] It is common in claims for damages arising from personal injury for treating physicians to testify as to the plaintiff's attendance for medical care, diagnosis, and treatment. In summary, the evidence that the plaintiff sought treatment and that the treating physician made certain observations, diagnoses, and treatment recommendations is evidence of facts that the physician personally observed in his or her assessments of the plaintiff and the plaintiff's medical status before treatment, during treatment, and up to the time the physician testifies. This evidence is not admissible as opinion evidence for the truth of the physician’s observations, diagnosis, or assessment before and during treatment. Rather, such evidence is admissible for the truth that the plaintiff attended on that physician and that the physician made certain observations, diagnoses, and treatment recommendations: Edmondson v. Payer , 2011 BCSC 118; Firman v. Asadi , 2018 BCSC 2437; Anderson v. Dwyer , 2009 BCSC 1872; Cambie Surgeries Corporation v. British Columbia (Medical Services Commission) , 2016 BCSC 1390 at para. 22; Cambie Surgeries Corporation v. British Columbia (Attorney General) , 2016 BCSC 2161 at para. 46; and Cambie Surgeries Corporation v. British Columbia (Attorney General) , 2018 BCSC 514 at paras. 35, 36, and 39. [4] This approach is equally applicable to health care providers who are not physicians and can include evidence that might be characterized as opinion evidence from a person with expertise. For example, in Anderson , a chiropractor was permitted to testify as to the anatomical features he observed on X-rays. The chiropractor's interpretation of the X-rays was informed by his training and expertise. Mr. Justice Schultes characterized the observation as fact, not an opinion, even though the chiropractor was seeing facts that may be invisible to a person who did not have his training. [5] The defendants brought Welch v. Tietge , 2017 BCSC 395 to my attention. In that decision, Mr. Justice Johnston said that treating physicians who are called without the plaintiff serving opinions that satisfy Rules 11-6 and 11-7 are confined to giving evidence of date on which the doctor saw the patient, any tests or examinations conducted, and any prescriptions or recommendations given. They are not permitted to stray into areas of opinion, such as what the doctor concluded as a result of tests or examinations conducted or what the doctor's opinion was as to the probable efficacy of any prescriptions or recommendations given to the plaintiff (at para. 59). [6] However, Johnston J.’s statement in Welch was not made in the context of discussing whether such evidence was admissible and for what purpose, but rather in the context of deciding whether to draw an adverse inference from the failure to call such evidence. In that regard, it is obiter when it is considered in a case where the issue is admissibility. It is inconsistent with the weight of authority on admissibility as I have described. [7] The law pertaining to the evidence of health care professionals testifying as to facts overlaps with the body of law pertaining to so called “lay opinion evidence”. The seminal case on lay opinion evidence is Graat v. The Queen , [1982] 2 S.C.R. 819. In McKnight v. Bourque , 2018 BCSC 1342 at para. 53, Madam Justice DeWitt-Van Oosten, then of this court, described lay opinion evidence as evidence of “an impression formed or inference drawn by a witness in a non-specialized area, based on personal observations or information gathered by that individual,” where the impression or inference is conveyed to the fact finder in the form of an opinion. Madam Justice DeWitt-Van Oosten cited Graat for that proposition. She noted that the opinion sometimes takes into account the witness’s practical experience. She gave what she termed classic examples of lay opinion evidence, such as the police officer who expresses an opinion of a person’s level of impairment by alcohol based on observable symptoms of intoxication or who provides an estimate of the speed of a vehicle. [8] I agree with counsel for the defendants that there is a continuum of lay opinion evidence. At some point, it is not admissible unless it is the subject of an expert report prepared by a person with appropriate qualifications and delivered in accordance with the Rules . In Anderson , Mr. Justice Schultes said the distinguishing line is between evidence of facts that someone with special training perceives versus subjective judgment applied to those facts. The latter is not admissible unless it is the subject of an expert report in compliance with the Rules . [9] For example, in Cannon v. Al Perrett Enterprises Inc. , 2018 BCSC 337, Madam Justice Donegan permitted the evidence of a police officer who attended the scene of the accident after the accident had occurred and prepared an investigative report that was not prepared for the purpose of the litigation or served in the litigation. Madam Justice Donegan permitted the police officer to testify as to what he observed, including his estimate of the length of skid-marks of one of the vehicles involved in the accident and the origin of rubber and scrape marks he observed at the site of the accident. However, she did not permit him to testify as to the cause of the skid-marks, the motorcycle speed at the time of the crash, or the cause of the crash itself. She characterized the evidence as opinion evidence for which an expert must be properly qualified to offer the opinion and his or her evidence must be relevant and not subject to any exclusionary rule. Madam Justice Donegan cited the law pertaining to lay opinion evidence but found that the police officer's opinions went beyond what the police officer saw and did and went to the principal issue in the case. In addition, because the opinions went beyond matters of everyday inferences from observed facts and there was no evidence of the police officer's experiential capacity to form the opinion, those opinions were classic expert opinions for which a report must be delivered from an expert who is qualified to give such opinions at trial. [10] It is apparent that evidence that could be characterized as opinion evidence may be admissible as fact evidence (e.g., evidence of a diagnosis tendered for the fact that the diagnosis was made, not that the diagnosis was correct) or as fact evidence by someone who, by virtue of training or experience, can perceive things that others cannot see. At the same time, it is apparent that in some cases such evidence is not admissible unless the rules pertaining to expert reports have been complied with or the court gives leave to dispense with the rules regarding expert evidence. The issue in this case is where the line is between admissibility and inadmissibility and the application of that to the facts of this case. [11] In my view, the authorities demonstrate that the location of the line depends on the facts of the case, the nature of the evidence, and the purpose for which the evidence is being tendered. If it is only tendered for the fact that the opinion was reached, it is usually admissible. Where the facts on which the opinion is based are not relevant in and of themselves and it is really the opinion that is relevant, or where the opinion is central to the case and requires subjective judgment to reach, it is not admissible because it is an impermissible circumvention of the expert evidence rules. Similarly, if the person giving the evidence did not personally observe the events that she or she is interpreting, then it is classic expert evidence that is hearsay and must comply with the rules pertaining to expert evidence reports in order for it to be admissible. [12] With these principles in mind, I turn to the will-say statement of Dr. Rose. The will-say statement is three pages in length and consists of paragraphs under headings. [13] I preface my discussion of the will-say statement by saying that in my view, most of it falls into the category of permissible evidence from a treating health care professional. The bulk of the will-say statement refers to Mr. Dunn’s visits to Dr. Rose, Dr. Rose’s observations of Mr. Dunn, his diagnosis of Mr. Dunn, his treatment of Mr. Dunn, and his observations regarding Mr. Dunn’s progress. [14] I note that the latter issue, the progress he observed, is a matter that includes opinion evidence, as is the evidence pertaining to diagnosis. Evidence of diagnosis and progress, as well as the characterization of some of the observations made by Dr. Rose are admissible for the fact that he observed those things, made the diagnosis, and concluded certain things about progress. They are not evidence of the truth of the opinions that they contain. [15] I will address the portions of the will-say statement that the defendants made specific submissions to by paragraph. The paragraphs are not numbered, so for the purpose of referring to them in these reasons, I have numbered them with paragraph number 1 being the paragraph immediately under the heading \"Background\" and starting \"he is a duly registered psychologist.\" The will-say statement ends at paragraph 21 on page 3 at the second paragraph under the heading \"Current Treatment.\" That paragraph begins “to date he has provided over 80 sessions of therapy.” [16] Paragraph 5 of the will-say statement reads as follows: He observed Mr. Dunn become repeatedly startled by unexpected motion in the interview room. He observed Mr. Dunn flinch when he made sudden movements with his own arm during discussions. Mr. Dunn appeared anxious. Mr. Dunn was emotionally fragile, which was consistent with his experience interviewing other patients in a clinical setting who were diagnosed with posttraumatic stress. The severity of Mr. Dunn's PTSD symptoms were comparable to the more severe cases of PTSD in police and military members, some of whom have been rendered unemployable by those symptoms. [17] In my view, the first three sentences of paragraph 5 describe evidence of Dr. Rose’s observations of Mr. Dunn, which do not stray into the area of technical observations for which expertise is required. The fourth sentence commencing “Mr. Dunn was emotionally fragile” may arguably require special training or have been the subject of the application of Dr. Rose's special training, but it is consistent with the type of lay opinion evidence permitted from persons with special training to draw inferences from facts that other persons may not be able to draw: Anderson . [18] Continuing with paragraph 5 of the will-say statement, I am of the view that the anticipated evidence in the last sentence in that paragraph, which commences with “the severity of Mr. Dunn's PTSD symptoms”, strays into the area of evidence that is inadmissible because it is the opinion of the type that notice ought to have been given in compliance with the Rules . In that sentence of the will-say statement, the plaintiff anticipates that Dr. Rose will testify about the plaintiff’s symptoms as compared to those of persons in certain categories. I assume by the description that Dr. Rose will refer to persons who have experienced extremely traumatic events. This observation and opinion made by Dr. Rose is one that relies on his observations outside of the observations he made of Mr. Dunn, i.e. , his observations and experience in treating police and military members, and so relies on facts not in evidence in this trial. It also relies on a level of expertise that is beyond that of permissible “lay opinion evidence” given by a person with special training or experience. It is a type of expert opinion evidence that is hearsay and it is the application of subjective judgment to draw inferences from facts. It is not admissible. [19] The next paragraph over which there is an issue is at paragraph 7, which reads as follows: He administered six separate tests to Mr. Dunn. Mr. Dunn easily fulfilled the criteria from the DSM-V for chronic post-traumatic stress disorder. Mr. Dunn has PTSD and related symptoms across all realms with symptoms in the severe to extreme ranges. He noted individual scale scores measuring intrusion of experience, avoidance, depression, and suicidal ideation, for in the 99th percentile, and his impression was that these were specific areas of concern for Mr. Dunn. [20] The defendant objects to all of the anticipated evidence except that described in the first sentence of paragraph 7. I conclude that the evidence described in the first and second sentences is admissible as evidence of Dr. Rose’s observations and conclusions he reached based on his assessment of Mr. Dunn. In the second sentence the word “easily” is inappropriate for lay opinion evidence and should not form part of Dr. Rose’s evidence. The evidence described in the third sentence is partly admissible and partly inadmissible. The part that is inadmissible is the part that reads “with symptoms in the severe to extreme ranges.” This anticipated evidence is subjective and requires Dr. Rose to apply his judgment as a psychologist to form a comparative opinion. In addition, it appears to call upon facts that are not in evidence in this case. It is not admissible for the purpose that Dr. Rose reached this conclusion during his treatment of Mr. Dunn, as there is no relevance to this comparison. The evidence is only relevant if the opinion is true. [21] The fourth sentence of paragraph 7 records Dr. Rose's observations from his testing. It is relevant and so it is admissible for the fact that he recorded that observation, not that it was a correct observation. [22] Paragraph 8 reads as follows: Mr. Dunn was someone suffering from marked distress and was severely impaired. Mr. Dunn's extreme distress put him at a high risk for suicide. Mr. Dunn reported drinking four or five beers per night to cope with his suffering. The drinking was new since the accident. [23] The defendant objects to the first and second sentences of this paragraph. In my view, this paragraph records Dr. Rose's observations and conclusions he reached. Those observations and conclusions are admissible for the fact that he made those observations and reached those conclusions in the course of his assessment and treatment of Mr. Dunn. They are not admissible for the truth of them. [24] The defendant objects to the evidence described in paragraph 9, which reads as follows: At that point, it was highly unlikely that Mr. Dunn would see a gradual abatement of his severe traumatic stress symptoms over time. He identified a variety of complicating variables, including: • Mr. Dunn's incomplete fragmented recollection of his traumatic experience; • an atypical event exposure involving multiple and potentially compounding moments of thinking that he would die or be severely injured; • the possibility that emotional responding to the event have been suppressed or avoided; • ongoing physical pain scarring and other related physical reminds [ sic ] serving as inescapable reminders of the accident; and • continuing problematic beliefs and vigilant behaviours. [25] In my view, this anticipated evidence, like paragraph 8, is about Dr. Rose's conclusions that assisted with his diagnosis and treatment plan for Mr. Dunn. The evidence is admissible for the fact that Dr. Rose reached those conclusions for those reasons, which then formed the basis of his recommended treatment plan. Again, they are admissible as facts of the conclusions that Dr. Rose reached and not for the truth of the conclusions. [26] The defendants object to the evidence described in paragraph 13, which reads as follows: Mr. Dunn's fragmented memories of the accident were continuing to be a complicating factor in his recovery. Mr. Dunn's tendency to dissociate was limiting his processing of emotional reactivity linked to the accident. [27] I am of the view that although this evidence appears to be an opinion that may call for subjective conclusions in the application of judgment, it is admissible to demonstrate the factors that played into Dr. Rose's continuing treatment and the treatment length of Mr. Dunn. Again, the evidence is not admissible for the truth of the conclusions he reached, but merely that he reached those conclusions and that played a role in Mr. Dunn's treatment. [28] The defendants object to the anticipated evidence set out in paragraph 16 of the will-say statement, which reads as follows: He noted improvement in Mr. Dunn. By May 2019 [ sic ] was that Mr. Dunn still had a diagnosis of PTSD but it was an early partial remission. Mr. Dunn was still vulnerable to triggering events. He identified that Mr. Dunn was continuing to experience residual symptoms of PTSD, including obsessive-compulsive behaviour and hyperarousal symptoms (irritability, anger, sleep impairment, memory, concentration, and attention failures, exaggerated startle response, panic and hypervigilance). He also noted episodic driving-related anxiety. [29] With regard to the first two sentences, the defendants put those portions of Dr. Rose’s records to the plaintiff in cross-examination as to the duration and severity of the plaintiff's emotional status. They object to the rest of the paragraph. That objection is not consonant with their reliance on the first two sentences because those sentences are no different from the rest of the paragraph. They are Dr. Rose's observations at points in time and a description of his observations of Mr. Dunn at those points in time. The evidence in that paragraph is admissible for the fact that Dr. Rose drew those conclusions and made those observations at the respective points in time. [30] The defendants also object to portions of paragraphs 19 and 20. In my view, the anticipated evidence in the portions of those paragraphs to which the defendants object falls into the same category as paragraph 16 and is admissible on the same basis. [31] Dr. Rose may testify in accordance with these reasons. “Matthews J.”"},"meta":{},"created_at":"2022-03-02T17:19:05.435605Z","updated_at":"2022-03-07T22:58:46.460961Z","project":1},{"id":3,"annotations":[{"id":9,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"start":3,"end":40,"text":"THE SUPREME COURT OF BRITISH COLUMBIA","labels":["COURT_NAME"]},"id":"uu3eeSnUYU","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":51,"end":82,"text":"Dosanjh v.

Johal, 2021 BCSC 150 Date: 20210111 Docket: M140866 Registry: Vancouver Between: Jasmeen Kaur Dosanjh Plaintiff And Harman Johal, Davinder Johal, Inderjit Jammu and Bhupinder Sandhu Defendants And Insurance Corporation of British Columbia Third Party And: Docket: M156884 Registry: Vancouver Between: Jasmeen Kaur Dosanjh Plaintiff And Sandip Natasha Samra Defendant Before: The Honourable Madam Justice Matthews (Appearance via telephone) Oral Reasons for Judgment In Chambers Counsel for Jasmeen Kaur Dosanjh appearing by teleconference: D. Miura Counsel for the Third Party Insurance Corporation of British Columbia appearing by teleconference: C.G. Kelly Counsel for Natasha Samra appearing by teleconference: R.W. Richardson No other appearances Place and Date of Hearing: Vancouver, B.C. January 11, 2021 Place and Date of Judgment: Vancouver, B.C. January 11, 2021 [1] These two actions rise out of a motor vehicle accident that occurred on October 12, 2013, in which Jasmeen Kaur Dosanjh was a passenger in a vehicle driven by the defendant, Sandeep Natasha Samra. During a police chase, a vehicle driven by the defendant Harman Johal and owned by the defendant Davinder Johal ran a red light and struck a vehicle driven by Inderjit Jammu which then struck the Samra vehicle. The Samra vehicle and a vehicle driven by the defendant Bhupinder Sandhu also collided. Ms. Dosanjh's injuries are significant. Her claim has been valued by the Third Party, the Insurance Corporation of British Columbia. It is likely that all of the claims arising from this accident against the third party insurance available will exceed the amount of insurance. Ms. Dosanjh has underinsured motorist protection, but under the terms of that policy, that first party insurance is not available until she has exhausted her claim against the third party insurance. ICBC is prepared to waive its right that she exhaust her claims so long as certain declarations are made. [2] Accordingly, Ms. Dosanjh and ICBC seek a declaration that ICBC may pay advances to Ms. Dosanjh from her underinsured motorist protection and the advances paid will not extend the limits of the third party liability insurance of the Johal defendants. As well, they seek a declaration that all claimants, including Ms. Dosanjh, will remain entitled to their pro rata share of the insurance limit once all claims have been valued with the individual uninsured motorist protection issues to be dealt with following that sharing. Finally, they seek certain ancillary orders including costs. [3] I gave these reasons orally. I have edited them without changing the substance. [4] The orders are sought in both actions. They are as follows: 1. The Plaintiff, Jasmeen Kaur Dosanjh, and the Third Party seek the following declarations: a) The Third Party can pay to Jasmeen Dosanjh advance payments from her Underinsured Motorist Protection policy pursuant to Part 10 of the Insurance (Motor Vehicle) Act , BC Reg 447\/83; b) Any and all advances paid will not extend the Johal Defendants insurance limits of $2,000,000 under the policy issued by the Third Party to them (the “Insurance Limits”); c) All claimants, including the Plaintiff, will remain entitled to their pro rata share of the Insurance Limits once all claims have been valued, with the individual Underinsured Motorist Protection issues to be dealt with following that sharing; d) In the event that a claimant having a potential insurance third party claim against the Third Party dies or has a change in legal status prior to the time that all the Other Claimant’s claims against the Third Party are resolved, this declaration will have no effect on the legal consequence that would otherwise flow from the change; and e) The parties and respondents affected by this Declaration shall have leave to apply for further directions. 2. The parties each bear their own costs. [5] Based on the submissions of counsel, I am satisfied that all persons who ought to have notice and could be served have been served or given notice. I was advised that counsel believe that the claims of the driver of one of the vehicles that the Samra vehicle collided with, Bhupinder Sandhu, have been settled. Counsel for another claimant, Ms. Samra, is attending this application. Counsel for the plaintiff, Ms. Dosanjh, is also counsel for another claimant and so has notice of this application through counsel. In addition, notice has been given to a potential claimant, Mr. Jammu, of these applications. The Johal defendants have been breached by their insurance carrier and have not been reachable. [6] There are multiple claims arising out of this accident. In addition to Ms. Dosanjh’s claims, the driver of the vehicle in which Ms. Dosanjh was a passenger, Ms. Samra, has brought a claim. The other passenger in the Samra vehicle has brought a claim. Mr. Sandhu brought a claim. Mr. Jammu has brought a claim. One claim has a trial date in 2022 and the other two claims do not yet have trial dates. I have been advised that attempts have been made to resolve all the claims, but not successfully. [7] In this application, the ICBC as third party, supported by Ms. Dosanjh, applies to address the fact that Ms. Dosanjh’s claims for her serious injuries involve a third party insurance coverage which must be shared pro rata between the claims of all persons who advance them successfully. That pro rata determination, obviously, cannot be made until the conclusion of those claims by either trial or settlement. [8] Ms. Dosanjh has underinsured motorist protection in the amount of $2,000,000. ICBC is prepared to provide her compensation through that prior to the pro rata distribution of the third party insurance proceeds despite that the applicable policy requires Ms. Dosanjh to exhaust all other remedies which, in this case, would include her claim against the third party insurance. [9] The declarations sought are to protect ICBC from which protect ICBC from paying out more than it would be required to pay out if the usual steps in the policy required sequence are undertaken. [10] The declarations sought will address the fact that Ms. Dosanjh's serious injuries have resulted in a significant claim which has been valued but cannot be paid out. It is now seven years after the accident. The other claims will not be resolved in the foreseeable future. That leaves Ms. Dosanjh in a position where her claim is resolved or resolvable, but she cannot receive her compensation because her pro rata entitlement to the third party limit cannot be ascertained and her right to be compensated under her underinsured motorist protection are not available until she has exhausted her claim against the third party insurance. [11] This type of situation was addressed by Mr. Justice Betton in Clark v. Bullock , 2013 BCSC 164. The substance of the application was almost identical to this one, although the circumstances were slightly different in that the potential claimants included infants and therefore a very long limitation period before all the claims could be known and quantified. [12] Mr. Justice Betton set out the essential issues and his reasons for granting the declarations sought as follows: [23] In this particular case, ICBC determined that it would waive the entitlement that it has by virtue of the legislation to require that Mr. Clark exhaust all of his remedies, including awaiting the payment of his pro rata entitlement to the $5,000,000 coverage under the Bullock policy; that is, ICBC would waive its entitlement to insist on all of those steps being taken before accessing the underinsured motorist protection coverage. [24] The condition it attaches is that it requires a declaration from court that would protect it against the potential for having to pay out more than the amount of the Bullock policy. [25] With that concession or that position being adopted by ICBC, these parties come before me with a request for a declaration. That declaration essentially allows ICBC to access the underinsured motorist protection coverage available to Mr. Clark to pay the amount that Justice Barrow has determined Mr. Clark is entitled to with adjustments as agreed to by the parties. [26] This would effectively be an interim measure pending the determination of the other claims and, with that, the ability to determine Mr. Clark's pro rata entitlement to the $5,000,000 in coverage. At that stage, any of the appropriate adjustments would be made to make Mr. Clark whole, as it were, and to pay out, on a pro rata basis, other plaintiffs arising from the incident. [27] Of concern in any type of arrangement or declaration such as this is whether there is any risk to those other claimants that they would have their pro rata entitlement adversely affected by such an order. [28] Given the nature of the declaration which is sought here, I am satisfied that that risk is addressed. The arrangement that is proposed here would insure that each of those plaintiffs would have full entitlement to their pro rata share of that $5,000,000 in coverage. [13] I agree with Mr. Justice Betton's reasoning and adopt it in this case. The circumstances are substantively identical and the proposed settlement and declarations sought will resolve a problem without negatively affecting the rights of any of the other claimants or defendants. [14] Accordingly, the application is granted in the form set out in the notice of application, paragraphs 1(a) through (e) and paragraph 2 of both notices of application. [15] Anything arising, counsel? [16] [Discussion between counsel and the Court] [17] Thank you, counsel, for your comprehensive material and helpful submissions. “Matthews J.”"},"meta":{},"created_at":"2022-03-02T17:19:05.435456Z","updated_at":"2022-03-07T22:57:25.498018Z","project":1},{"id":2,"annotations":[{"id":8,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"start":50,"end":66,"text":" Diaz v.

Nowack, 2020 BCSC 112 Date: 20200107 Docket: M174884 Registry: Vancouver Between: Karen Pamela Diaz Plaintiff And Eilza Nowack and Conor Pacific Canada Inc. Defendants Before: The Honourable Madam Justice Choi Oral Reasons for Judgment In Chambers Counsel for the Plaintiff: P. Venegas G. Canniff Counsel for the Defendants: R. Raymond R. Mohan Place and Date of Hearing: Vancouver, B.C. January 6-7, 2020 Place and Date of Judgment: Vancouver, B.C. January 7, 2020 [1] THE COURT: This is a damages‑only personal injury action arising from a motor vehicle accident. Liability has been admitted by the defendants. The trial was set for 10 days to commence on January 6, 2020. The plaintiff applies for an order prohibiting the defendants from calling five witnesses, and to exclude any new witnesses except by court order. The plaintiff argues that the proposed witnesses were either not on a witness list by the ordered deadline, or their \"will say\" statements were not provided by the order deadline. Counsel attended a trial management conference (TMC) on November 29, 2019, at which Justice Masuhara set a defence deadline for \"will say\" statements and contact information for the witnesses of three weeks prior to the trial, being December 16, 2019, and for an exchange of trial schedules of two weeks before the trial, being December 23, 2019. [2] The plaintiff also applies to prohibit the defendants from tendering two documents into evidence because they were not produced on any lists of documents until the day before trial. There were no TMC orders respecting the deadline for production of documents from the defendants. An order was made at the TMC that the plaintiff's updated list of documents must be provided two weeks before the trial; there was no similar order made pertaining to the defendants. [3] The defendants ultimately provided a witness list on December 16, followed by updates to the list and evolving “will say” statements. The proposed defence witnesses at issue are as follows: 1) Derek Gulkison, the former spouse of the plaintiff and father to their child. He was on a witness list provided on December 16, 2019, but his \"will say\" statement was provided on December 30, 2019, and then expanded on January 2, 2020. 2) Judith Pinto, a director of human resources at a former employer for the plaintiff. She was on a witness list of December 23, 2019, with a \"will say\" statement provided on December 30, 2019. 3) Allison Spicer, the head of human resources of an employer where the plaintiff worked after the accident. She was on a witness list of December 23, 2019, but no \"will say\" statement has been provided. 4) Verna Ursula was on a witness list of December 16, 2019, but no \"will say\" statement has been provided. The defendants no longer intend to call Ms. Ursula as a witness. 5) Barry Wells, the CEO of an employer. He was on the defendants’ December 16, 2019 witness list, and his \"will say\" statement was provided on January 2, 2020. [4] The defendants plan to call these witnesses mainly as rebuttal witnesses depending on the plaintiff's direct testimony. The two documents in question consist of a Provincial Court order dated December 14, 2017, respecting parenting arrangements in the plaintiff's family law case and a document titled \"places mom and Parker have slept and\/or lived.\" Both were produced on the day before trial, i.e. , on Sunday, January 5, 2020, at 2:40 p.m. The defence counsel's communications noted that she only received the new documents the day prior, that being Saturday, January 4, 2020. [5] The plaintiff has provided three cases in support of her argument that I should not exercise my discretion to belatedly admit the evidence: Owens v. Steveston Waterfront Properties Inc. , 2019 BCSC 747; Tompkins v. Bruce (14 December 2011), Vancouver M070137 (B.C.S.C.); and Stone v. Ellerman , 2009 BCCA 294 at paras. 30–31. The defendants rely on Devathasan v. Devathasan , 2019 BCSC 1559; Davies v. Canada Shineray Suppliers Group Inc. , 2017 BCSC 304; Fu v. Zhu , 2017 BCSC 749; and Houston v. Kine , 2011 BCCA 358. Each of these cases sets out some basic factors the court might consider in exercising this discretionary power. These factors include whether: 1) there is prejudice to the other party; 2) there is a reasonable explanation for the delay; 3) the evidence is needed for a determination on the merits; and 4) the ends of justice require the evidence. [6] The defendants oppose the exclusion of the witnesses and documents on the basis that: 1) there will be serious prejudice since the plaintiff's evidence will be largely unchallenged because these are all the defendants’ lay witnesses; 2) the delay was caused because the instructing client did not authorize work to mobilize witnesses until close to the commencement of the trial and only after mediation was unsuccessful; 3) the defence evidence is required for a determination on the merits, if the plaintiff’s testimony is contrary to the information gathered; and 4) the ends of justice require a determination on the merits with all available evidence. [7] The plaintiff argues that the instructing defence policy should not be at her expense. The plaintiff is prejudiced if the trial proceeds with the last-minute inclusion of these witnesses because counsel will not have the chance to prepare, including searching for other witnesses that may contradict the defence witnesses. The plaintiff seeks an adjournment of the trial if the court will not grant the order to exclude the witnesses and documents. [8] For the reasons that follow, I adjourn the trial with costs thrown away payable forthwith to the plaintiff: 1) I am concerned that excluding the evidence might prevent the determination of the issues on the merits. Given the submissions, I anticipate the potential for serious conflicts in the evidence and for challenges to the plaintiff's credibility. Without the ability to rely on evidence from other witnesses and to use the said documents, there is a real risk the court will be hampered in its ability to determine the issues. 2) The proposed evidence may be important to the fact‑finding process. 3) I accept the plaintiff's argument that she will be prejudiced if the witnesses are allowed to testify at this time because she will not have time to adequately prepare. 4) The plaintiff is prejudiced by an adjournment as well, however, due to the time wasted in preparing for a second trial and by being delayed in an adjudication of her case. For this reason, I am awarding her costs thrown away, payable forthwith. 5) The defendants chose only to commence witness preparation at the last minute, only days before the TMC order deadline. This is a practice that deserves sanction and rebuke. Trial management conferences, the orders made there, and the deadlines set out in the Supreme Court Civil Rules are all designed to provide parties with time to prepare and to consider the strengths and weaknesses of their case, so a trial can proceed in an efficient manner. “Choi J.”"},"meta":{},"created_at":"2022-03-02T17:19:05.435354Z","updated_at":"2022-03-07T22:56:07.887710Z","project":1},{"id":1,"annotations":[{"id":7,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"start":3,"end":40,"text":"THE SUPREME COURT OF BRITISH COLUMBIA","labels":["COURT_NAME"]},"id":"t50w9jjsG9","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":51,"end":82,"text":"Dais v.

Maniago Counsel for the Respondents, Peter Virvilis and Dennis Virvilis: P.A. Spencer, Q.C. J.R. Facchin Counsel for the Respondents, John Virvilis and Virvilis Holdings Ltd. J.A. Rost A. Girou Place and Date of Trial: Vancouver, B.C. December 17, 2019 Place and Date of Judgment: Vancouver, B.C. January 14, 2020 [1] John Virvilis is a self-made man. He has been an excellent provider for his wife, Tassia Virvilis, and his children, Peter Virvilis, Helen Dais and Dennis Virvilis. [2] To distinguish various family members from one another, I will refer to them by their first names. In doing so, I intend no disrespect. [3] Sadly, conflict within the Virvilis family has resulted in protracted litigation. By way of written reasons for judgment released on March 21, 2018, I made a number of orders requiring that Helen be bought out of various family companies. My earlier reasons for judgment are indexed at 2018 BCSC 459. Though Peter and Dennis have a significant interest in the outcome, the current application relates only to a dispute between Helen on the one hand and John, Virvilis Holdings Ltd. (“Virvilis Holdings”) and Broadway Towers Holdings Ltd. (“Broadway Towers”) on the other. [4] During the initial hearing of Helen’s petition in 2018, the parties adduced extensive evidence about their family history as well as their ownership of various corporate entities, their varied contributions to the acquisition and operation of those entities, and the conflict that had resulted in irreconcilable differences between Helen and other family members in the operation of those entities. They did not provide any evidence regarding the value of their shareholdings. [5] On the evidence before me, I found that it was just and equitable to dissolve and liquidate the companies under s. 324(1)(b) of the Business Corporations Act , S.B.C. 2002, c. 57 [ BCA ]. Having made that finding, all of the so-called “oppression remedies” under s. 227(3) of the BCA were available to me. [6] None of the parties wanted the family companies to be dissolved and liquidated. Rather, they sought to have Helen removed by different means. With respect to Broadway Towers, I concluded that it was most appropriate to make the following orders: … 4. Broadway Towers, or its nominee, is ordered to purchase Helen’s shares in Broadway Towers at their fair market value determined as of the date of this order by an independent business valuator who is satisfactory to each of Helen and John discounted by 40%. The terms of payment are to be determined by Helen and John. 5. In the event of disagreement between Helen and John regarding the valuation of Broadway Towers or terms of payment, each has leave to apply for directions. … [7] Helen and John were able to agree on a business valuator, Greg Williamson of Williamson Valuation and Litigation Support Ltd. They were unable to agree on the appropriate method to determine the fair market value of Helen’s shares in Broadway Towers or payment terms. They seek direction. [8] Helen and John also ask that I address the costs of the previous application. [9] Helen seeks to have her shares in Broadway Towers valued using a market value approach based on the highest and best use of the commercial property owned by Broadway Towers with no additional minority or marketability discount applied. Based on Mr. Williamson’s work and an application of the 40% discount I ordered, this would result in Helen receiving $6,041,734 for her shares. [10] John seeks to have Helen’s shares valued at $2,000,000, which is all that he says Broadway Towers can afford without unduly disrupting his and Tassia’s retirement income from Broadway Towers. This amount is based roughly on the value of Helen’s shares in Broadway Towers using an income approach after applying the 40% discount I ordered, with no additional minority or marketability discount applied. In the alternative, if a market value approach is used, John submits that minority and marketability discounts ought to be applied on top of the 40% discount I ordered. [11] Regarding costs, as half of the previous application related to Helen’s dispute with her father and half related to her dispute with her brothers, she seeks one-half of her costs against her father and Virvilis Holdings. She has resolved the issue of costs in relation to her dispute with her brothers directly with them. [12] John submits that success was divided and that he and Helen should therefore bear their own costs in relation to the previous application. He notes that Helen withdrew her oppression and unfair prejudice claims against him at the last minute and that she sought the fair market value of her shares with no discount applied. [13] The relevant background is set out in some detail in my earlier reasons for judgment. In these reasons, I will simply summarize the most salient points. [14] John emigrated from Greece to Canada in 1954 with nothing more than his work ethic and business acumen. He married Tassia in 1960. Peter was born in 1961, Helen in 1963 and Dennis in 1968. John is 91. Tassia is 81. [15] John has been very successful in business. Relatively soon after arriving in Canada, he opened a restaurant in Vancouver. As a result of the success of the restaurant, he incorporated a company which became Broadway Towers. In the 1970s and 1980s, Broadway Towers owned a number of apartment buildings. In the 1980s, Broadway Towers sold the last of these buildings and purchased a retail centre, Lougheed Village, in Coquitlam. [16] In 2004, John and Tassia effected an “estate freeze” in connection with Broadway Towers for estate planning purposes. As a result, on January 30, 2004, John and Tassia’s shares in the company were sold to the company in exchange for new Class D preferred non-voting redeemable shares. The Class D shares were valued at $2,292,000, which reflected the value of Lougheed Village at that time. John was issued 49 Class A voting shares and Tassia was issued one Class A voting share. Each of Peter, Helen and Dennis were issued 100 Class B common non-voting shares valued at $0.01 each. [17] In 2014, the preferred Class D voting shares of Broadway Towers were transferred to Virvilis Holdings, a company which is controlled by John. Currently, John is the sole director of Broadway Towers. [18] The parties focussed much of their submissions on what I had “obviously” intended in my previous reasons for judgment. The trouble is that the parties disagreed on what was so obvious about my reasons. [19] Given the focus of the parties’ submissions on my earlier reasons, I will set out in full my critical conclusions regarding the appropriate remedy at paras. 156-166: The Appropriate Remedy [156] In considering the appropriate remedy as between Helen and John, it bears repeating that determining a fit remedy is so fact-dependant that little guidance can be taken from comparing one case to another: Wilson at para. 56. [157] In the circumstances of Helen’s claim against John and Broadway Towers, there is no evidence concerning what would happen to the shares of Peter, Helen and Dennis in the event of family discord and the prospect of future deadlock. Because of the conflicting affidavit evidence, I am not in a position to lay “blame” on any party for Helen’s departure. I am determining the appropriate remedy in the context of irreconcilable family differences, not in the context of any wrongdoing. I cannot treat this as a case where Helen has been involuntarily ousted from Broadway Towers nor as a case where she is departing voluntarily. I also cannot take into account the stress experienced by John and Tassia any more than I can take into account how Helen feels about her experiences within the family and Broadway Towers. [158] There are, however, a number of factors which favour an earlier valuation date and\/or greater discount. [159] For starters, right or wrong, Helen has had very little to do with the success of Broadway Towers. Even on her evidence, Helen’s contributions are dated and minimal in relation to her father’s contributions. Further, Helen’s shares were issued as part of an estate freeze for estate planning purposes. She could never have expected to extract any value for her shares while her parents were alive. [160] On the other hand, a number of factors favour a current valuation date and\/or no discount. [161] Helen’s position with Broadway Towers has not changed. She was not expected to make a contribution to Broadway Towers in return for her shares. If not for the breakdown in family relationships, Helen would, in time, have derived substantial benefit from her shares in Broadway Towers, without any effort on her part whatsoever. [162] After having considered all of the circumstances, I consider the most appropriate and fair remedy to be that Broadway Towers or its nominee repurchase Helen’s shares at their current fair market value discounted by 40%. [163] In my view, this valuation date and discount best meets the reasonable expectations of the parties in a way which is fair and least intrusive. Helen will still receive substantial value for her shares, with the discount reflecting that she will receive that value much earlier than she could reasonably have expected. At the same time, John will maintain control of Broadway Towers and, given Helen’s willingness to receive payment over time, there is no reason for me to think that Lougheed Village would have to be sold or that John and Tassia’s retirement income stream significantly impaired. [164] I have chosen a current valuation date because I expect that it will be easier and less expensive to complete than a historic one. Had I determined that an earlier valuation date would have been appropriate, I would have applied a lesser discount. In addition to ease of determination, from the perspective of fairness, I should add that, if land values had decreased rather than increased, I would have imposed the same remedy. [165] Accordingly, I order that Broadway Towers, or its nominee, purchase Helen’s shares in Broadway Towers at their fair market value determined as of the date of this order by an independent business valuator who is satisfactory to each of Helen and John, discounted by 40%. The terms of payment are to be determined by Helen and John, failing which they can apply for directions. [166] John raised an issue at the hearing regarding the most appropriate valuation method but I received no evidence on the alternatives. If Helen and John are unable to agree on the valuation method, they can apply for directions. [20] Regrettably, imperfections in my reasons have caused the parties consternation. More regrettably, they did not simply ask me to clarify my reasons at a much earlier stage. [21] At this point, the only intellectually honest thing I can do is to provide the clarity that the parties could have and, with all due respect, should have sought much sooner. I consider it completely inappropriate for me to interpret my own reasons for judgment or to allow the parties to reargue their cases. While I do not consider it appropriate to bolster my previous reasons for judgment in any way, I do consider it necessary to add a few words of explanation. [22] In rendering my decision, I was fully aware that Helen’s shareholdings in Broadway Towers would be very difficult to sell on the open market for a variety of reasons. They represented a minority shareholding within a closely held family company. They would not offer a theoretical third party purchaser control now or in the future. Further, they offered no dividend and would not offer a dividend for an unknown period of time. The circle of theoretical third party purchasers would be small and any theoretical sale would only be completed if the value of the shares was discounted. [23] When I awarded Helen the fair market value of her shares in Broadway Towers discounted by 40%, I intended for that to convey that I considered it “fair” to determine the fair market value of Broadway Towers and then apply a 40% discount to Helen’s interest in Broadway Towers. I did not intend for any minority and\/or marketability discount to be applied in addition to the 40% discount. Had I intended for any additional discount to be applied, I would have said so. [24] Further, when I awarded fair market value discounted at 40%, I intended for the fair market value of Broadway Towers to be determined based on what a willing buyer would pay a willing seller for all of the shares in Broadway Towers on the open market. I did not intend for the estimate of the fair market value of Broadway Towers’ shares to be limited in any way by hypothetical conditions, such as an assumption that the commercial property owned by Broadway Towers would be subject to a non-existent restriction on development. [25] In this case, the income value approach to the valuation of Broadway Towers’ shares does not reflect what I ordered. It is based on the assumption that the commercial property owned by Broadway Towers does not have re-development potential such that a theoretical third party purchaser would only be acquiring the current stream of income generated by Broadway Towers into the future. This is a false assumption. Broadway Towers does have re-development potential. A willing seller would never sell Broadway Towers to a willing purchaser based on the income value approach for $13,510,000 rather than on the highest and best use of the commercial property owned by Broadway Towers for $32,415,000. [1] [26] Even though John does not intend to re-develop the commercial property owned by Broadway Towers, for these reasons, Broadway Towers or its nominee must purchase Helen’s shares based on the market value approach employed by Mr. Williamson discounted by 40%. According to Mr. Williamson’s report, after making certain necessary and appropriate deductions from the market value of Broadway Towers, the purchase price for Helen’s shares is $6,041,734. [27] In rendering my original decision, I was somewhat handicapped by the extent of the evidence adduced by the parties. I endeavoured to be sensitive to John’s desire that he not be forced to sell Broadway Towers and that his and Tassia’s retirement income from Broadway Towers not be unduly limited. Given Helen’s flexibility regarding payment terms, I had no reason to think my order would produce either of these outcomes. I continue to have that view. [28] John has now adduced evidence regarding Broadway Towers’ income, how much money he and Tassia require in their retirements and how much debt Broadway Towers can carry without impairing his and Tassia’s retirement income. This information was not helpful to me in clarifying my original order regarding the valuation of Helen’s shares in Broadway Towers but is helpful to me in setting out how Broadway Towers or its nominee can complete the purchase of Helen’s shares. [29] Helen has very thoughtfully proposed that Broadway Towers or its nominee pay her $2,000,000 on the closing of the purchase of her shares. Helen would then have judgment against Broadway Towers for the balance of the purchase price, namely $4,041,734, with interest on the outstanding amount at the registrar’s rate for post-judgment interest. Helen would be free to register her judgment against the title to property owned by Broadway Towers but enforcement of her judgment would otherwise be stayed pending certain events. [30] Subject to some relatively minor tweaking, mostly regarding the lifting of the stay, I will make the order sought by Helen. [31] In the previous application, John sought to defeat Helen’s claims in relation to Broadway Towers in their entirety. He argued that her shares in Broadway Towers had not been validly issued or, in the alternative, if they had been validly issued that they were subject to a resulting trust in favour of John and Tassia. I rejected these arguments which resulted in a judgment in favour of Helen. While the remedy was only 60% of what Helen was seeking, she received a very significant award. I consider her to have been the substantially successful party. [32] Had Helen not advanced then abandoned oppression and unfair prejudice claims, I would have awarded her one-half of her costs of the previous application at Scale B. To recognize the time spent by John preparing for the claims that were abandoned at the last minute, I consider it appropriate to order John and Virvilis Holdings to pay her one-third of her costs of the previous application at Scale B. [33] I make the following order: 1. Helen’s shares in Broadway Towers shall be purchased by Broadway Towers or its nominee for $6,041,734, with $2,000,000 to be paid on closing and the remainder to be paid over time. 2. The closing of the sale of Helen’s shares in Broadway Towers shall occur on or before February 28, 2020, or such later date as agreed by the parties. 3. Helen shall transfer all of her shares in Broadway Towers on the closing date. 4. Helen shall have judgment against Broadway Towers for the balance of the purchase price in the amount of $4,041,734 (the “Money Judgment”), with interest to be paid on the outstanding amount of the Money Judgment on and after March 1, 2020 at the registrar’s rate for post-judgment interest that is in force from time to time. 5. On or after March 1, 2020, Helen may register the Money Judgment against the title to any real property owned by Broadway Towers. 6. Subject to paragraph 7 of this order, execution on the Money Judgment is otherwise stayed until: a. The later of the death of John or Tassia; b. Any change in control of Broadway Towers; or c. Any re-development of the property owned by Broadway Towers having a civic address of 403 North Road, Coquitlam, British Columbia. 7.

OF APPEAL FOR BRITISH COLUMBIA Citation: Zhao v. Zhou, 2019 BCCA 12 Date: 20190108 Docket: CA45269 Between: Yu Rong Zhao Respondent (Plaintiff) And Shou Zhi Zhou Appellant (Defendant) Corrected Judgment: The text of the judgment was corrected on the front page on January 15, 2019. Before: The Honourable Mr. Justice Groberman The Honourable Mr. Justice Fitch The Honourable Madam Justice Griffin On appeal from: An order of the Supreme Court of British Columbia, dated April 10, 2018 ( Zhao v. Zhou , 2018 BCSC 567, Vancouver Docket S155364). Oral Reasons for Judgment Counsel for the Appellant: J.M. Richter A.M. James The Respondent, appearing in person: Y.R. Zhao (J. Mo, Interpreter) Place and Date of Hearing: Vancouver, British Columbia January 4, 2019 Place and Date of Judgment: Vancouver, British Columbia January 8, 2019 Summary: The plaintiff brought an action against the defendant in China, alleging that he misappropriated corporate assets to which she was entitled, and failed to pay her on a promissory note. The defendant avoided service, and the claim was dismissed (with a right to re-file) on the basis of a lack of service. The plaintiff then brought a similar action in British Columbia. The defendant applied to have it dismissed for lack of territorial competence, and, in the alternative, sought to have the British Columbia courts decline jurisdiction on the basis that China was the appropriate forum. The chambers judge dismissed the application. He ruled that the court had territorial competence. While he accepted that a number of factors favoured declining jurisdiction in favour of China, he found that the defendant’s failure to cooperate in the litigation in that country favoured having the matter proceed in British Columbia. On appeal, held: Appeal allowed in part. The judge’s finding of territorial competence is not effectively challenged on appeal. A number of factors, however, show China to be a more appropriate forum: the subject matter of the litigation is most connected with China; Chinese law will be applicable, the witnesses are located in China, and the evidence will be presented in a Chinese language. The defendant asserts that he will respond to litigation in China. The British Columbia litigation should be temporarily stayed to allow the defendant to show that he will cooperate in having the litigation proceed in China. [1] GROBERMAN J.A. : In the court below, the defendant applied to strike the plaintiff’s action on the basis that the court lacked territorial competence over it. In the alternative, he applied to have the court decline territorial competence on the basis that China is a more appropriate forum in which to adjudicate the claims. The judge held that the courts of British Columbia have territorial competence. While he considered that a number of factors point to China as the most suitable forum for the claims, he considered that the Supreme Court of British Columbia should, nonetheless, continue to exercise its territorial competence over them. He did so primarily on the basis that the defendant had engaged in conduct that impeded the plaintiff from proceeding in China. [2] As I will indicate, I agree with much of the judge’s analysis, but consider that it is appropriate to grant a temporary stay of the British Columbia litigation with a view to allowing the matter to proceed in Chinese courts. There are marked advantages from the standpoint of the administration of justice to having the matter proceed in China, because: a) the subject matter of the litigation is more closely connected with China; b) the law of China will be the applicable law; c) witnesses are located in China; and d) most (perhaps all) of the evidence will be presented in a Chinese language. Background [3] The notice of civil claim in this matter is not well-drafted, but the parties have been of some assistance in clarifying the background of the action and describing the claims that are being pursued. [4] The parties were married to each other from February 17, 1997 to July 4, 2005, and again from September 7, 2005 to July 13, 2009. Both marriages and both divorces took place in China. The parties resided (at least some of the time) in Canada after March 24, 2008, though they have also resided in China. [5] In March 2000, during their first marriage, the parties incorporated a business in China. Ms. Zhao had a 20% interest in the business, and Mr. Zhou held a 70% interest, with the remaining 10% held by a relative of Ms. Zhao. Ms. Zhao claims the company was profitable, but says that Mr. Zhou took steps to conceal the profits and to appropriate them to himself. The pleadings are not entirely clear as to the mechanisms of the alleged misappropriation. Ultimately, however, she claims that Mr. Zhou took the company’s assets, investing some of the money in a property in Burnaby which he continues to hold. [6] Ms. Zhao signed an agreement that purported to resolve all remaining differences between the parties at the time of the couple’s second divorce. She says, however, that she was unaware of Mr. Zhou’s misappropriations of business assets when she signed that agreement. [7] In May 2011, Ms. Zhao confronted Mr. Zhou and demanded compensation in respect of her interest in the business. The two met, in China, and Mr. Zhou signed a promissory note in the amount of ¥4.2 million [1] in her favour. According to Ms. Zhao, the note represented agreed compensation for Mr. Zhou’s misappropriations from the company. He says that it was nothing of the sort, and that the note was signed under duress and is unenforceable. [8] The parties agree that Mr. Zhou paid Ms. Zhao ¥100,000 in April 2012. Ms. Zhao claims that this was a payment on account of the promissory note. Mr. Zhou denies that, saying that the amount represented the final payment of amounts he owed in respect of the second divorce settlement. [9] The parties have subsequently been involved in three court actions in China. First, Mr. Zhou brought an action on December 6, 2012 to set aside the promissory note on grounds of duress. On December 21, 2012, Ms. Zhao brought her own action in a different Chinese court to enforce the promissory note. [10] On January 21, 2013, a court in China ordered Mr. Zhou’s claim to be transferred to the court in which Ms. Zhao’s claim was brought, so that the claims could be heard together. On January 30, 2013, however, Mr. Zhou applied to withdraw his claim, and his application was granted. [11] On May 15, 2013 Ms. Zhao obtained an order from the Chinese court freezing certain of Mr. Zhou’s assets. She was unable, however, to locate and serve Mr. Zhou, resulting in the court dismissing her claim on June 6, 2013. The court dissolved the freeze order three days later. [12] The affidavit material filed in the court below indicates that Ms. Zhao’s inability to serve Mr. Zhou was due to his refusal to provide her with an address, and his failure to make good on promises to appear and defend the matter in China. Those allegations appear to be supported by an official document authored by the judge who dismissed the claim on June 6, 2013. It appears that the dismissal was not a final order, and that Ms. Zhao was entitled to re-file her claim with the Chinese court. The parties have not been able to tell this Court whether she still retains that right. [13] The day before her action against Mr. Zhou was dismissed, Ms. Zhao commenced a separate action, in China, against the corporation. The corporation filed a defence, and successfully opposed an application for disclosure of corporate records. After further court proceedings, Ms. Zhao withdrew her claim on terms. It appears that some settlement was reached as to costs, and it is common ground that no claim remains against the company, [14] In the current British Columbia action, Ms. Zhao makes claims for damages against Mr. Zhou, as well as a tracing order to assert a trust claim in the Burnaby property. Territorial Competence [15] Territorial competence must be determined under s. 3 of the Court Jurisdiction and Proceedings Transfer Act , S.B.C. 2003, c. 28. The relevant provisions are as follows: 3. A court has territorial competence in a proceeding that is brought against a person only if … (d) that person is ordinarily resident in British Columbia at the time of the commencement of the proceeding, or (e) there is a real and substantial connection between British Columbia and the facts on which the proceeding against that person is based. [16] The judge described the proposition that Mr. Zhou was ordinarily resident in British Columbia when the action was commenced as “disputed and thinly supported”. He nonetheless found that there was sufficient support for the proposition to satisfy the “arguable case” threshold described in Purple Echo Productions, Inc. v. KCTS Television , 2008 BCCA 85. He therefore held that the courts of British Columbia had territorial competence over the claim under s. 3(d) of the statute. [17] The judge also considered that the court had territorial competence under s. 3(e). In doing so, he applied the presumptions set out in s. 10 of the statute. He considered that if Mr. Zhou was ordinarily resident in British Columbia when he committed the alleged wrongs, then it was arguable that they were committed in British Columbia. [18] The judge also found that the trust claim over the Burnaby property was a basis for finding a real and substantial connection with British Columbia. I would comment, however, that the notice of civil claim includes inconsistent claims, asserting a trust claim over the Burnaby property while also stating that the only claim under which a trust could arise was surrendered in exchange for a promissory note. If this matter ultimately proceeds in British Columbia, the notice of civil claim will need to be amended to clearly set out the nature of the claims being pursued. [19] On this appeal, Mr. Zhou does not challenge the judge’s finding that the courts of British Columbia have territorial competence over the claims on the basis of s. 3(d). In my view, the judge’s findings on that issue are sustainable, and it is therefore unnecessary to determine whether territorial competence is also established under s. 3(e). Discretion to Decline Territorial Competence [20] Section 11 of the Court Jurisdiction and Proceedings Transfer Act gives a court discretion to decline to exercise territorial competence: 11(1) After considering the interests of the parties to a proceeding and the ends of justice, a court may decline to exercise its territorial competence in the proceeding on the ground that a court of another state is a more appropriate forum in which to hear the proceeding. (2) A court, in deciding the question of whether it or a court outside British Columbia is the more appropriate forum in which to hear a proceeding, must consider the circumstances relevant to the proceeding, including (a) the comparative convenience and expense for the parties to the proceeding and for their witnesses, in litigating in the court or in any alternative forum, (b) the law to be applied to issues in the proceeding, (c) the desirability of avoiding multiplicity of legal proceedings, (d) the desirability of avoiding conflicting decisions in different courts, (e) the enforcement of an eventual judgment, and (f) the fair and efficient working of the Canadian legal system as a whole. [21] The judge found that the comparative convenience and expense considerations favoured having the matter proceed in China. He noted that nearly all of the evidence, witnesses and documents relevant to the case are in China, the documents are in Chinese, and the witnesses speak a Chinese language. [22] He also found that Chinese law will most probably be applicable in the proceeding, another factor making China the more appropriate forum for the litigation. The judge did note that the claim includes a tracing claim with respect to the Burnaby property, and that British Columbia may have some advantages as a forum in respect of that claim. [23] The judge was not convinced that avoiding a multiplicity of legal proceedings decisively favoured having the matter proceed in China. He noted that there is not, at present, any active litigation between the parties in that country. He did note, however, that the history of legal proceedings “to some extent” favoured having the matter proceed in China. [24] The judge did not consider the avoidance of conflicting decisions in different courts to be a relevant consideration in this case, given the absence of any determination of the issues on the merits in the Chinese courts. Accordingly, he described that consideration as a neutral factor. [25] The judge did find one factor favouring the exercise by the Supreme Court of its territorial competence: [89] [T]he plaintiff raises an issue of fundamental fairness. She argues that the defendant ought not to be heard to argue that China is clearly the more appropriate forum for the resolution of this dispute when he avoided service there (and, she adds, breached a promise he made to the Chinese court to attend court and deal with the claim)…. … [91] In the absence of a response from the defendant to the plaintiff’s allegations as to why the proceedings in China never progressed to the point of addressing the merits, I agree with the plaintiff that the interest of fairness weighs in favour of allowing this action to proceed. Did the Judge Err in Deciding to Exercise Territorial Jurisdiction? [26] In my view, the judge took note of appropriate factors under s. 11 of the Court Jurisdiction and Proceedings Transfer Act . I would note, however, that there is no discussion in his judgment of the extraordinarily difficult task that would face a British Columbia court in trying this action. The proceedings are likely to be very lengthy, given that the evidence will be heard in translation, and the court will require thorough explanation of the foreign law and corporate culture. The difficulties inherent in deciding issues of credibility in such circumstances should not be underestimated. [27] It is fair to say that the judge found that the various factors overwhelmingly favoured China as the appropriate forum for resolution of the litigation. He was justifiably troubled, however, by the fact that Ms. Zhao’s attempt to litigate the matter in China had been thwarted by Mr. Zhou’s actions. [28] In the result, the judge refused Mr. Zhou’s application for the court to decline territorial competence in favour of China. The judge’s order includes the following: 2. The defendant’s application in the alternative for an order pursuant to Rule 21-8(2) of the Supreme Court Civil Rules and section 11 of the [ Court Jurisdiction and Proceedings Transfer Act ] staying some or all of the claims against the defendant in this proceeding on the ground that the Court ought to decline to exercise jurisdiction over him in respect of the said claims be and hereby is dismissed [29] In this Court, Mr. Zhou, through his counsel, has indicated that he is prepared to be cooperative in having this matter proceed in China. He has agreed to accept service of process through his Canadian counsel, and has represented that he is now prepared to defend this matter in China. [30] In my view, these promises, if kept, effectively deal with the concerns of the chambers judge. [31] In the result, I am of the view that it was premature for the judge to determine that the Supreme Court of British Columbia should exercise territorial competence in this matter. Instead, it should do so only if it becomes clear that the Chinese courts are unable to adjudicate the matter. [32] I would set aside paragraph 2 of the judge’s order, and substitute the following: 2. The defendant’s application pursuant to Rule 21-8(2) of the Supreme Court Civil Rules and section 11 of the [ Court Jurisdiction and Proceedings Transfer Act ], staying this action on the ground that the Court ought to decline to exercise jurisdiction over the action is granted, and the action is stayed for a period of six months to allow proceedings to be commenced or continued in China. [33] The parties are at liberty to apply to the Supreme Court of British Columbia to extend, make permanent, or lift the stay. It should be apparent, within the six month period, whether Mr. Zhou is being forthright in saying that he will cooperate in having this matter determined in China. That information will be of great importance to the Supreme Court in deciding how to exercise its discretion. [34] The six month stay will also allow the parties to establish whether the claims can, in fact, proceed in China, and whether those proceedings will be efficient. That information will assist the Supreme Court in determining whether British Columbia should decline to exercise its territorial competence. [35] The stay will expire in six months if the Supreme Court does not make an order extending it. It will be up to the parties to make an application to that court within the six month period. If the Supreme Court makes no order in respect of the stay, Ms. Zhao will be able to continue with the British Columbia action. [36] There is a certificate of pending litigation registered against the Burnaby property. The parties are agreed that it should remain in place during the temporary stay. I agree. For at least the six month period, this litigation remains pending, though it is in a state of suspension. [37] I would not disturb the award of costs in the court below. In my view, success is divided in this Court, and I would order that the parties bear their own costs of the appeal. [38] FITCH J.A. : I agree. [39] GRIFFIN J.A. : I agree. [40] GROBERMAN J.A. : The appeal is allowed to the extent set out in my reasons. Costs in the court below remain as ordered by that court. Each party will bear their own costs in this Court. “The Honourable Mr. Justice Groberman” [1] I use “¥” here to refer to refer to the Chinese currency, known as the “Renminbi” or “Yuan”.

Wang, 2021 BCCA 56 Date: 20210203 Docket: CA47038 Between: Zhongwu Yang Respondent (Plaintiff) And Zi An Wang aka Zian Wang Appellant (Defendant) Before: The Honourable Madam Justice Saunders The Honourable Mr. Justice Groberman The Honourable Madam Justice Stromberg-Stein On appeal from: An order of the Supreme Court of British Columbia, dated August 11, 2020 ( Yang v. Wang , 2020 BCSC 1176, Vancouver Docket S151416). Oral Reasons for Judgment The Appellant, appearing in person (via videoconference): Z. Wang Counsel for the Respondent (via videoconference): J. Jiang Place and Date of Hearing: Vancouver, British Columbia February 3, 2021 Place and Date of Judgment: Vancouver, British Columbia February 3, 2021 Summary: The appellant applied to a Supreme Court judge to set aside a default judgment on a promissory note. The default judgment was granted on December 7, 2015. The appellant claims not to have known of the judgment, or of the action against him, until after a garnishing order was entered on February 22, 2016. Even after becoming aware of the judgment, however, he delayed bringing an application to set it aside for four years. The judge refused to set aside the default judgment, finding that he met none of the criteria for such an order. On appeal, the appellant seeks to file additional evidence. Held: Application to adduce additional evidence denied; appeal dismissed. The appellant provides no adequate reason for his failure to adduce the evidence at first instance, and it is, in any event, only tangentially relevant to the application. The chambers judge applied the correct test to setting aside a default judgment, and made no errors in her findings. [1] GROBERMAN J.A. : This is an appeal from a refusal by a judge of the Supreme Court to set aside a default judgment. There is, along with the appeal, an application to adduce fresh evidence. [2] The underlying proceeding was commenced in February 2015. It alleged that the respondent lent the appellant $90,000, and that the appellant gave the respondent a promissory note in December 2013, undertaking to repay the loan by the end of 2014. The entire balance of the loan remained unpaid at the date the action was commenced. [3] The respondent made several attempts to serve the plaintiff with the notice of civil claim, both at his residence and at his place of work. It appears that the appellant was evading service. On October 16, 2015, a master granted an order for substitutional service, requiring the respondent to serve the appellant at his work email address, and by registered mail to a business address. [4] On December 7, 2015, after finding that the appellant had failed to file an appearance within the time limited following substitutional service, default judgment was entered. A garnishing order followed on February 22, 2016. The appellant became aware of the garnishing order by March 4, 2016. He did not apply to set aside the default judgment for over four years, filing his notice of application on June 2, 2020. [5] The appellant’s explanation for his delay relates to his mother’s mental condition. Without any details or medical evidence, he states that his mother suffered a recurrence of depression in 2014, and that the depression lasted for a considerable length of time. In his affidavit, he says: [When] I receive[d] the default judgment [in] this case[,] I hesitated and chose not [to respond to] the judgment. It was only because of my worry [about] my mother’s mental condition. [6] In his oral submissions today, the appellant also made reference to his youth and the fact that he had not grown up in Canada, suggesting that his naivety with respect to the court system was also an important factor. [7] In her comprehensive reasons for judgment, the judge set out the history of the case, and applied the factors in Miracle Feeds v. D. & H. Enterprises Ltd. (1979), 10 B.C.L.R. 58 at 61 (Co. Ct.) to decide whether to exercise her discretion to set aside the judgment. It has long been accepted in this Province that those are the correct factors to consider on an application to set aside a default judgment. [8] The judge found that the appellant had been properly served with the civil claim. Although she did not say so in terms, it is clear that she concluded that he was either aware of the civil action in 2015, before default judgment was issued, or, if he was unaware of it, it was through deliberate efforts on his part to avoid receipt of the notice of civil claim. [9] She found that when he became aware of the default judgment in 2016, he failed to move expeditiously to set it aside, and that his failure was wilful and deliberate. The mere statement that his mother was depressed had little evidentiary value, and did not serve, in any way, to explain why he could not have moved to set the judgment aside. [10] The judge also found that the affidavit material filed by the appellant did not establish that there was a defence worthy of investigation, let alone a meritorious defence to the action. She noted, as well, that many of the appellant’s allegations were not supported by affidavit evidence. [11] Finally, she found that the passage of time served to prejudice the respondent in his ability to prove his case. [12] I can detect no error in the judge’s approach or analysis. [13] The application to this Court to adduce fresh evidence seeks to introduce some banking records and includes other documents that provide some support for certain aspects of the appellant’s version of the facts surrounding his financial dealings with the respondent. The material does not meet the test in Palmer v. The Queen , [1980] 1 S.C.R. 759. There is no adequate explanation as to why the evidence could not, with due diligence, have been adduced in the court below. The evidence is, in any event, tangential to the issues in the case, and far from conclusive on any issue that is critical to the claim. [14] None of the arguments or characterizations of fact presented today cast doubt on the judge’s findings. In particular, it is apparent that the appellant wilfully failed to respond to the notice of civil claim, and then unreasonably delayed in moving to set aside the default judgment. He still does not present any meritorious defence to the respondent’s claim. [15] I would affirm the judgment below and dismiss the appeal. [16] SAUNDERS J.A. : I agree. [17] STROMBERG-STEIN J.A. : I agree. [18] SAUNDERS J.A. : The appeal is dismissed. “The Honourable Mr. Justice Groberman”"},"meta":{},"created_at":"2022-03-03T02:25:43.697452Z","updated_at":"2022-03-07T20:34:55.472805Z","project":1},{"id":25,"annotations":[{"id":31,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"start":3,"end":40,"text":"THE SUPREME COURT OF BRITISH COLUMBIA","labels":["COURT_NAME"]},"id":"RoMx2moJ5I","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":51,"end":88,"text":"Watson v.

Scouts Canada, 2020 BCSC 41 Date: 20200114 Docket: S1811356 Registry: Vancouver In the Matter of the Judicial Review Procedure Act , R.S.B.C. 1996, c. 241 Between: Andrew Donald Watson, P. Eng Petitioner And Scouts Canada Respondent Before: The Honourable Mr. Justice Skolrood Reasons for Judgment Counsel for the Petitioner: J. Rai Counsel for the Respondent: E.E. Vanderburgh Place and Date of Trial\/Hearing: Vancouver, B.C. October 4, 2019 Place and Date of Judgment: Vancouver, B.C. January 14, 2020 [1] This is an application brought by the respondent Scouts Canada pursuant to R. 21-8 of the Supreme Court Civil Rules to strike out portions of the petition on the basis that this Court lacks jurisdiction. [2] The petition advances a claim for judicial review under the Judicial Review Procedure Act , R.S.B.C. 1996, c. 241 [ JRPA ], of a decision by Scouts Canada to terminate the membership of the respondent Andrew Donald Watson. [3] The central question on this application is whether the claims raised in the impugned paragraphs of the petition fall within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Federal Court pursuant to s. 18 of the Federal Courts Act , R.S.C. 1985, c. F-7 [ FCA ]. [4] It is not necessary to review in great detail the background facts to the judicial review application, however I will provide a brief overview. [5] Mr. Watson is a professional engineer who was involved with Scouts Canada for approximately 43 years. On November 2, 2017, Scouts Canada terminated his membership (the “Termination Decision”). This followed a temporary suspension issued on or about May 12, 2017, for conduct allegedly in violation of Scouts Canada’s code of conduct and a subsequent review by Scouts Canada’s national review committee. The reasons for the suspension and ultimate termination are not relevant to this application. [6] Scouts Canada is a corporation continued pursuant to a federal statute, An Act respecting Scouts Canada , S.C. 2007, c. 38 [ Scouts Canada Act ]. Under s. 7 of the Scouts Canada Act , Scouts Canada is empowered to pass bylaws governing a number of matters, including membership. [7] Pursuant to this power, Scouts Canada has enacted a bylaw setting out different categories of membership. Scouts Canada has also established a comprehensive set of policies and procedures governing the affairs of the organization, including the investigation and discipline of members. [8] Scouts Canada’s termination of Mr. Watson’s membership was purportedly done in accordance with the bylaw and its policies and procedures. [9] On October 22, 2018, the petition was filed seeking judicial review. Scouts Canada filed its response on December 7, 2018. [10] The matter proceeded to a hearing on April 4, 2019, but it was adjourned to permit Scouts Canada to raise the jurisdictional issue underlying its present application. Scouts Canada did not challenge this Court’s jurisdiction in its response to petition, however on April 17, 2019, it filed a jurisdictional response. [11] Section 2(2) of the JRPA is the key operative section in respect of Mr. Watson’s application for judicial review: (2) On an application for judicial review, the court may grant any relief that the applicant would be entitled to in any one or more of the proceedings for: (a) relief in the nature of mandamus, prohibition or certiorari; (b) a declaration or injunction, or both, in relation to the exercise, refusal to exercise, or proposed or purported exercise, of a statutory power. [12] Scouts Canada relies on s. 18(1) of the FCA which states: 18 (1) Subject to section 28, the Federal Court has exclusive original jurisdiction (a) to issue an injunction, writ of certiorari , writ of prohibition, writ of mandamus or writ of quo warranto , or grant declaratory relief, against any federal board, commission or other tribunal; and (b) to hear and determine any application or other proceeding for relief in the nature of relief contemplated by paragraph (a), including any proceeding brought against the Attorney General of Canada, to obtain relief against a federal board, commission or other tribunal. [13] Section 28 of the FCA , which is referred to in s. 18, confers exclusive jurisdiction on the Federal Court of Appeal to hear judicial review applications in respect of certain enumerated tribunals. That section has no application here. [14] Section 2(1) of the FCA defines “federal board, commission or other tribunal” to mean: … any body, person or persons having, exercising or purporting to exercise jurisdiction or powers conferred by or under an Act of Parliament … [15] Both parties cite the decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in Highwood Congregation of Jehovah’s Witnesses (Judicial Committee) v. Wall , 2018 SCC 26. While this case is more applicable to the merits of Mr. Watson’s judicial review application, the analysis also helps inform the jurisdictional issue. [16] Wall involved an application for judicial review of a decision of a congregation of Jehovah’s Witnesses to expel a member. The Alberta Court of Queen’s Bench and the Court of Appeal both held that the courts had jurisdiction to consider the application, but the Supreme Court of Canada disagreed. [17] In finding that judicial review was not available, Justice Rowe, speaking for the Court, said: [ 14 ] Not all decisions are amenable to judicial review under a superior court’s supervisory jurisdiction. Judicial review is only available where there is an exercise of state authority and where that exercise is of a sufficiently public character. Even public bodies make some decisions that are private in nature — such as renting premises and hiring staff — and such decisions are not subject to judicial review: Air Canada v. Toronto Port Authority , 2011 FCA 347 , [2013] 3 F.C.R. 605 , at para. 52 . In making these contractual decisions, the public body is not exercising “a power central to the administrative mandate given to it by Parliament”, but is rather exercising a private power ( ibid. ). Such decisions do not involve concerns about the rule of law insofar as this refers to the exercise of delegated authority. [ 15 ] Further, while the private law remedies of declaration or injunction may be sought in an application for judicial review (see, for example, Judicial Review Procedure Act , R.S.B.C. 1996, c. 241, s. 2(2)(b); Judicial Review Procedure Act , R.S.O. 1990, c. J.1, s. 2(1)2; Judicial Review Act , R.S.P.E.I. 1988, c. J-3, ss. 2 and 3(3)), this does not make the reverse true. Public law remedies such as certiorari may not be granted in litigation relating to contractual or property rights between private parties: Knox , at para. 17. Certiorari is only available where the decision-making power at issue has a sufficiently public character: D. J. M. Brown and J. M. Evans, with the assistance of D. Fairlie, Judicial Review of Administrative Action in Canada (loose-leaf), at topic 1:2252. … [ 20 ] In my view, these cases do not make judicial review available for private bodies. Courts have questioned how a private Act — like that for the United Church of Canada — that does not confer statutory authority can attract judicial review: see Greaves v. United Church of God Canada , 2003 BCSC 1365 , 27 C.C.E.L. (3d) 46 , at para. 29 ; Setia , at para. 36. The problem with the cases that rely on Setia is that they hold that where a decision has a broad public impact, the decision is of a sufficient public character and is therefore reviewable: Graff , at para. 18; West Toronto United Football Club , at para. 24. These cases fail to distinguish between “public” in a generic sense and “public” in a public law sense. In my view, a decision will be considered to be public where it involves questions about the rule of law and the limits of an administrative decision maker’s exercise of power. Simply because a decision impacts a broad segment of the public does not mean that it is public in the administrative law sense of the term. Again, judicial review is about the legality of state decision making. [18] It is common ground between the parties that if Scouts Canada falls within the definition of a “federal board, commission or other tribunal”, then the Federal Court has exclusive jurisdiction to judicially review its decisions: see Canada (Attorney General) v. TeleZone Inc. , 2010 SCC 62 at para. 47; Ehattesaht First Nation v. British Columbia (Agriculture and Lands) , 2011 BCSC 658 at para. 23, leave to appeal ref’d 2011 BCCA 325. [19] Somewhat ironically, Scouts Canada takes the position that it is not in fact a “federal board, commission or other tribunal”. In its response to the petition, Scouts Canada describes itself and the Termination Decision as follows, at para. 16: Scouts Canada, its agents, employees, officers and volunteers have no statutory decision-making authority and do not act on behalf of the federal or any provincial government or any state-actor. The Decision is a private decision concerning membership in a voluntary association that is not reviewable by the courts, either by way of judicial review or in a private law action. [20] Scouts Canada does not dispute that if its characterization is correct, that it is a private, voluntary association, this Court has jurisdiction to determine whether the Termination Decision had a sufficiently public character to nonetheless render it subject to judicial review. [21] However, Scouts Canada submits that it is the manner in which Mr. Watson has framed the judicial review application that gives rise to the jurisdictional issue and its application to strike. Scouts Canada points in particular to the following parargraphs of the petition: 65. Scouts Canada is established by an act of [Parliament]. Its powers, including powers to enact bylaws concerning membership and discipline of its members, are conferred by the Scouts Canada Act . This Act operates as a statutory grant of authority and the decision to terminate the Petitioner’s membership is a statutory decision subject to judicial review. However, even if Scouts Canada is considered a domestic tribunal, the nature of its decisions regarding investigation of complaints and discipline of its members have a sufficiently public character such that the termination decision is subject to judicial review. (As noted above, Scouts Canada acknowledges that the second ground raised in the last sentence of para. 65 is within this Court’s jurisdiction to determine). 66. Scouts Canada is created by a federal statute, but judicial review is within the purview of the provincial superior courts, not the Federal Court as Scouts Canada is not a federal board, commission or tribunal [or] enumerated in s. 28 of the [ FCA ]. … 73. … a. In Wall , the Court observed that incorporation by a private Act does not necessarily operate as a statutory grant of authority but held that a decision is sufficiently public in character, and therefore reviewable, if it involves “questions about the rule of law and the limits of an administrative decision maker’s exercise of power”. The decision to terminate the Petitioner’s membership in Scouts Canada, purportedly in accordance with bylaws enacted pursuant to the Scouts Canada Act , squarely puts in issue the legality of Scouts Canada’s decision-making and raises questions regarding respect for and compliance with the rule of law. [22] Scouts Canada submits that on the face of the petition, in particular the first part of para. 65, Mr. Watson alleges that in making the Termination Decision, Scouts Canada was exercising a statutory power under a federal statute (the Scouts Canada Act ) which brings the Termination Decision squarely within the ambit of s. 18 of the FCA . [23] However, this is not Mr. Watson’s position. As reflected in part in para. 66 of the petition, reproduced above, although created by a federal statute, Mr. Watson argues Scouts Canada is not a “federal board, commission or other tribunal” and s. 18 of the FCA does not apply. [24] Mr. Watson cites Cameron v. Albrich , 2011 BCSC 549, where the court observed that not every exercise of a power conferred by a federal statute renders the decision-maker a “federal board, commission or other tribunal” (at paras. 46-48). [25] Mr. Watson also cites Canadian Judicial Council v. Girouard , 2019 FCA 148, where the court confirmed the two-part test for determining whether a body is a “federal board, commission or other tribunal” (at para. 34): a) What jurisdiction or power is the body seeking to exercise; and b) What is the source or origin of that jurisdiction or power? [26] Mr. Watson submits that there needs to be a more thorough assessment of this test in order to determine whether Scouts Canada meets the definition of a “federal board, commission or other tribunal”, something which is beyond the proper scope of this application to strike. [27] Mr. Watson submits further that the impugned paragraphs deal with the statutory framework within which the Termination Decision was made, which is relevant to determining whether Scouts Canada is a public decision-maker or if the activities in question have a sufficiently public character, to render the Termination Decision subject to judicial review. [28] As I have noted, Scouts Canada’s application to strike on jurisdictional grounds is based on a premise that both it and Mr. Watson reject, namely that it is a “federal board, commission or other tribunal”. [29] Nonetheless, Scouts Canada submits that Mr. Watson has pleaded jurisdictional facts that, if true, establish that it meets the definition as such and falls within s. 18 of the FCA . Scouts Canada submits further that its application must be determined on the basis as the facts as pleaded. [30] The difficulty with this position is that the impugned paragraphs (65, 66 and 73(a)) all appear in the “Legal Basis” section of the petition rather than the “Factual Basis” section. Each of the paragraphs contains statements that are in the nature of legal arguments or conclusions rather than facts. In particular, para. 73(a) advances an argument that on its face is intended to bring the Termination Decision in line with the principles set out in Wall . I therefore do not agree with Scouts Canada that these paragraphs plead jurisdictional facts that bring the claim within the scope of s. 18 of the FCA . [31] While the language used in para. 65 does potentially give rise to a question about the applicability of s. 18 of the FCA , that paragraph must be read alongside para. 66 where it is alleged that Scouts Canada is not in fact a “federal board, commission or other tribunal”. [32] Further, I agree with Mr. Watson that the statutory framework is relevant to determining the true character of Scouts Canada, i.e. public or private body, and the nature of the Termination Decision. Both the statutory framework in which a decision-maker operates and the nature of the decision itself must be considered when determining whether judicial review is available (see Strauss v. North Fraser Pretrial Centre (Deputy Warden of Operations) , 2019 BCCA 207 at para. 40). [33] As noted above at para. 20 and parenthetically at para. 21, Scouts Canada concedes that this Court has jurisdiction to hear that part of the petition that alleges the Termination Decision was sufficiently public in character as to attract judicial review under s. 2(2)(a) of the JRPA . Thus, even if the impugned paragraphs could be struck because of the exclusive jurisdiction of the Federal Court under s. 18 of the FCA (which I do not agree is warranted), they are relevant to issues that properly fall within this Court’s jurisdiction. [34] Finally, if Scouts Canada succeeds on this application, with the result being that Mr. Watson must bring part of his judicial application in the Federal Court, it is quite possible that the Federal Court will decline jurisdiction on the ground that Scouts Canada is not in fact a “federal board, commission or other tribunal”. That no doubt is the position that Scouts Canada would take which, if successful, would ultimately result in the parties returning back before this Court. Such a result would be inconsistent with the objective of securing a “just, speedy and inexpensive determination” of the petition: Supreme Court Civil Rules , R. 1-3(1). [35] The better approach, in my view, is for the proper characterization of Scouts Canada to be determined in this proceeding in a hearing on the merits of the petition. [36] Scouts Canada’s application to strike portions of the petition is dismissed. [37] Costs will be in the cause. “Skolrood J.”"},"meta":{},"created_at":"2022-03-03T02:25:43.697393Z","updated_at":"2022-03-07T20:15:33.800439Z","project":1},{"id":24,"annotations":[{"id":30,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"start":0,"end":36,"text":"COURT OF APPEAL FOR BRITISH COLUMBIA","labels":["COURT_NAME"]},"id":"VTlpme_8IH","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":47,"end":95,"text":"Szopa v.

Canada (Attorney General), 2020 BCCA 47 Date: 20200128 Docket: CA45625 Between: Stanislaw Szopa Appellant (Plaintiff) And The Attorney General of Canada Respondent (Defendant) Before: The Honourable Madam Justice Bennett The Honourable Mr. Justice Willcock The Honourable Mr. Justice Goepel On an application to vary: An order of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia, dated December 10, 2018 ( Szopa v. Canada (Attorney General) , Vancouver Docket CA45625). Oral Reasons for Judgment The Appellant, appearing in person: S. Szopa Counsel for the Respondent: A. Gardner Place and Date of Hearing: Vancouver, British Columbia January 28, 2020 Place and Date of Judgment: Vancouver, British Columbia January 28, 2020 Summary: The appellant seeks to vary an order of a justice that dismissed his application for leave to appeal an order which had dismissed his action as showing no cause of action. In the event, this Court converts the appellant’s notice of application for leave to appeal into a notice of appeal, the respondent seeks an order quashing the appeal on the basis that it is devoid of merit. Held: The appellant was entitled to bring his appeal as of right notwithstanding its lack of merit. Accordingly, the order is varied and the notice of application for leave to appeal is converted into a notice of appeal. The appeal is however devoid of any arguable merit and respondent’s application to quash the appeal is allowed. [1] GOEPEL J.A. : The appellant seeks to vary an order of a justice, pronounced on December 10, 2018, which dismissed his application for leave to appeal the August 30, 2018 order of Mr. Justice Macintosh which had dismissed his action as showing no cause of action. He also seeks a no-fee order. [2] In the event this Court converts the appellant’s notice of application for leave to appeal into a notice of appeal, the respondent seeks an order quashing the appeal on the basis that it is devoid of merit. In the alternative, the respondent seeks an order for security for costs of the appeal in the amount of $3,000. [3] The appellant emigrated from Poland with his family in 1981. In Poland, he had earned a master’s degree in mechanical engineering. In the process of immigrating to Canada, he interacted with an official of the Canadian Embassy in Vienna. That official marked down on his application for immigration that his profession was “automobile mechanic” rather than “master mechanical engineer”. [4] The appellant is of the view that because of that mistake on his papers, he could not find employment in Canada that was suitable to his training and skills. He alleges the government forced him to work in jobs that were beneath him and as a result, he and his family suffered economically and emotionally. He also says the government had a duty to properly inform him of the economic circumstances in Canada in 1981. [5] On February 28, 2018, the appellant commenced proceedings in the Supreme Court alleging that he had been mislead, that the government had made misrepresentations to him and that he should have a remedy for those wrongs. He claimed $23 million in damages, resulting from his loss of employment income from not being able to work as a mechanical engineer in Canada. He also claimed damages for mental distress resulting from his lower standard of living because of the work he was required to undertake. [6] The respondent applied to have the action struck out as disclosing no cause of action. On August 30, 2018, Justice Macintosh struck out the claim. His reasons are indexed at 2018 BCSC 2164. [7] The appellant then filed a notice of application for leave to appeal. That application, together with an application for a no-fee order came on for hearing in this Court on December 10, 2018. The chambers judge dismissed his application for leave to appeal. She did so on the basis that the action was without merit. In that regard she said: [10] My task on an application for leave to appeal is to act as a gatekeeper – to ensure that judicial resources are not expended on matters that do not merit the attention of a full division of this Court, but also to ensure that self-represented litigants do not expend the money and effort to put forward an appeal that would ultimately results in costs orders being made against them. [11] When I look at the decision of Mr. Justice MacIntosh, it is apparent that he read the claim very liberally. He looked past some of the deficiencies in the form, recognizing Mr. Szopa is a self-represented litigant. He considered whether it would be possible, if the claim was re-framed, to establish a claim for negligent misrepresentation. The judge concluded that it could not be. He found that Mr. Szopa’s claim did not fall into the category of a novel claim, which has a reasonable prospect of being recognized at common law. In other words, the judge looked at the claim and asked if this was the kind of claim, like the Tobacco litigation, where the court would move incrementally to recognize this as an appropriate case to expand the law and permit someone to bring forward this kind of claim. He concluded that it did not have that kind of prospect. I agree with Mr. Justice MacIntosh, as the law is quite settled and it does not appear that there would be any prospect that this claim would be recognized. There is also the problem of the limitation period. As the judge explained, this is a claim that arose in 1981. Even recognizing that Mr. Szopa has had some mental health problems, he was capable of asserting his concerns to the newspaper, for example, and of bringing them to the attention of the government. It seems Mr. Szopa, that despite your disabilities, you are a person capable of commencing a legal action by filing a notice of civil claim, as you have. There is not enough in the record to suggest that for the more than 30 years that have passed, you were unable to bring an action, to start a case and proceed with the litigation. So, for that reason too, it seems to me that your claim would be bound to fail. Ultimately, you would have to convince a division of this Court that Mr. Justice MacIntosh made errors which would warrant overturning his decision and reinstating your notice of civil claim. That, in my view, would not happen, even before a full division. [12] For these reasons, I have to dismiss the application for leave to appeal. As that is the case, it is not necessary for me to fully address the application for no-fee status or for the extensions of time. I would dismiss those applications as well as they fall because the leave to appeal cannot be granted. [8] The appellant did not immediately seek a review of the chambers judge’s order. Rather, he filed a notice of application for leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada. That application was dismissed as premature. [9] On November 4, 2019, the appellant applied in chambers for an order extending the time to seek a review of the order of the chambers judge dismissing his application for leave to appeal. On that hearing, the respondent conceded that the appellant did not require leave to appeal the order striking his claim. The appellant had an appeal as of right. This point, however, apparently had not been brought to the attention of the chambers judge when the leave to appeal application was heard in chambers. In the result, Mr. Justice Hunter granted the required extension of time to review the chambers judgment. [10] In Gonzalez v. British Columbia (Attorney General) , 2019 BCCA 88, this Court discussed the procedure to be followed when a party has a right to appeal but mistakenly brings an application for leave to appeal. In such circumstances, the chambers judge should convert, nunc pro tunc , the notice of application for leave to appeal into a notice of appeal and although a chambers judge may exercise discretion in granting the conversion, in exercising that discretion no consideration should be given to the merits of the proposed appeal. [11] That is the situation on this application. The appellant was entitled to bring his appeal as of right notwithstanding its lack of merit. The respondent does not suggest otherwise. Accordingly, I would allow the review and convert the notice of application for leave to appeal into a notice of appeal. [12] While the Court cannot consider the merits in regards to the conversion of the notice of leave to appeal into a notice of appeal, the merits are crucial to the other applications before the Court. The respondent seeks to quash the appeal because it is devoid of merit. The merits of the proposed appeal are also key to the determination of the no-fee and security for costs applications. [13] This Court has the inherent jurisdiction to quash an appeal that is so devoid of merit or substance as to constitute an abuse of the Court’s own procedure: Milani v. Milani , 2019 BCCA 361 at para. 13. In Milani , Justice Smith, speaking for the Court, said: [13] In these circumstances, I find Mr. Milani’s appeal of the Clarification Decision to be so devoid of any arguable merit as to amount to an abuse of process. This Court has the inherent jurisdiction to quash such an appeal as was confirmed in Kaiser (Re) , 2007 BCCA 253 at paras. 15–16: [15] Mr. Nicholson, for the trustee, cited Wiens v. Vancouver (City) (1992), 74 B.C.L.R. (2d) 154 (C.A.) as authority for the inherent jurisdiction of the Court to quash. Gibbs J.A., speaking for the Court, said at para. 3: There is ample authority for the principle that this Court has inherent jurisdiction to quash an appeal which is so devoid of merit or substance as to constitute an abuse of the Court’s own procedure. See, for example. Singh (Banns) v. Bank of Montreal (1979), [1980] 3 W.W.R. 403, 18 B.C.L.R. 149, 15 C.P.C. 89, 109 D.L.R. (3d) 117 (C.A.), and this passage from National Life Assurance Co. v. McCoubrey, [1926] S.C.R. 277, [1926] 2 D.L.R. 550 quoted therein [p. 118 D.L.R.]: “Every Court of Justice has an inherent jurisdiction to prevent such an abuse of its own procedure ( Reichel v. Magrath (1889), 14 App. Cas. 665, at p. 668). If an appeal, though within its jurisdiction, be manifestly entirely devoid of merit or substance, this Court will entertain favourably a motion to quash it, as it does in cases where costs only are involved … as a convenient way of disposing of the appeal before further costs have been incurred.” [16] But this is a power of the Court constituted as a division. The Act does not give the power to a single justice in chambers. [14] In this case, the chambers judge held that the appeal was without merit and would be bound to fail. I can see no errors in her conclusion. The appeal is so devoid of any arguable merit as to amount to an abuse of process. In the result, therefore, I would grant the respondent’s application and order the appeal be quashed. It follows the review of the appeal of the no-fee order is dismissed and it is not necessary to deal with the security for costs application. [15] Given the manner in which this appeal has come forward today, I would make no order as to costs. [16] BENNETT J.A. : I agree. [17] WILLCOCK J.A. : I agree. [18] BENNETT J.A. : The application of Mr. Szopa to set aside the refusal of leave to appeal is allowed, by consent. Leave to appeal was not required. The application by the Attorney General of Canada to have the appeal quashed is granted. It follows that the review of the refusal of the no-fee status is dismissed. Each party will bear their own costs. “The Honourable Mr. Justice Goepel”"},"meta":{},"created_at":"2022-03-03T02:25:43.697288Z","updated_at":"2022-03-07T18:11:19.108013Z","project":1},{"id":23,"annotations":[{"id":29,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"start":0,"end":36,"text":"COURT OF APPEAL FOR BRITISH COLUMBIA","labels":["COURT_NAME"]},"id":"kfBad_S5mG","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":47,"end":127,"text":"Staetter v.

British Columbia (Adult Forensic Psychiatric Services), 2022 BCCA 14 Date: 20220105 Docket: CA47739 Between: Christopher Michael Staetter Appellant And The Director of Adult Forensic Psychiatric Services and Attorney General of British Columbia Respondents Before: The Honourable Madam Justice Saunders The Honourable Madam Justice Griffin The Honourable Mr. Justice Abrioux On appeal from: A disposition of the British Columbia Review Board, dated August 4, 2021. Oral Reasons for Judgment The Appellant, appearing in person (via videoconference): C. Staetter Counsel for the Respondent Director of Adult Forensic Psychiatric Services (via videoconference): D.K Lovett, Q.C. Counsel for the Respondent Attorney General of British Columbia (via videoconference): J.L. Fogel Place and Date of Hearing: Vancouver, British Columbia January 5, 2022 Place and Date of Judgment: Vancouver, British Columbia January 5, 2022 Summary: The appellant seeks to change the conditions imposed on him as terms of a conditional discharge by the British Columbia Review Board. Held: Appeal dismissed. The decision of the Review Board was reasonable and supported by the evidence. [1] GRIFFIN J.A. : Mr. Christopher Michael Staetter appeals the August 4, 2021, disposition of the British Columbia Review Board (“Review Board”) maintaining his conditional discharge. [2] On October 19, 2012, Mr. Staetter was found not criminally responsible by reason of mental disorder (“NCRMD”) for charges of uttering threats and criminal harassment. The index offences arose from Mr. Staetter’s deeply entrenched delusions that he had a sexual relationship with a teenage girl, P.H., in 2004 and that she subsequently gave birth to his son. Mr. Staetter sent P.H. and her father many disturbing, violent and threatening voicemails and text messages in 2012. This conduct has deeply affected the victims. [3] Before today’s hearing we have had the opportunity to look at the evidence before the Review Board, the reasons of the Review Board, Mr. Staetter’s written submissions and the respondents’ submissions. For the reasons that follow, I would dismiss the appeal. [4] Mr. Staetter is 34 years old. His history of psychiatric involvement dates back to 2004 when, as a teenager, he was initially hospitalized and diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder. According to the Review Board, his treatment has been complicated by substance abuse disorder (involving mainly cannabis) and his distrust of psychiatric medication. [5] Mr. Staetter’s denial of his psychiatric condition and his need for treatment, combined with his persistent delusions that are resistant to treatment, has led the Review Board to regularly conclude that he continued to pose a risk to public safety. He has frequently exercised his right to bring appeals of the Review Board decisions, but he has not been successful. [6] For background, a brief review of Mr. Staetter’s litigation history in this Court is as follows: a) Appeal from the Review Board’s November 27, 2012, decision to detain Mr. Staetter at the Forensic Psychiatric Hospital (“FPH”) in Port Coquitlam, British Columbia, was dismissed: 2013 BCCA 307. b) In March 2013, Mr. Staetter’s application for an extension of time to appeal the finding of NCRMD was dismissed: 2013 BCSC 821. Leave to appeal that decision in this Court was dismissed by Lowry J.A. (June 26, 2013, CA40770), and an application to vary Lowry J.A.’s decision was dismissed for want of jurisdiction: 2014 BCCA 294. c) Appeals from the Review Board’s subsequent annual review dispositions to detain Mr. Staetter for further 12‑month periods were dismissed: 2015 BCCA 63, leave to appeal to SCC refused, 36396 (10 September 2015); 2016 BCCA 167; 2017 BCCA 68, leave to appeal to SCC refused, 38128 (22 November 2018); 2018 BCCA 125; 2019 BCCA 40; 2019 BCCA 337; 2019 BCCA 410. [7] Over the years since 2012, the Review Board has made many decisions regarding Mr. Staetter’s detention and, despite his resistance to treatment, has made attempts to reintegrate him into the community. Two of these attempts failed when Mr. Staetter’s mental status deteriorated and he relapsed into substance abuse and showed disinhibited behavior and resistance to treatment. [8] A third attempt to reintroduce Mr. Staetter to living in the community was more successful. Because of this, the Review Board decided on August 5, 2020, that his risk could be managed in the community. On that date, the Review Board granted him a conditional discharge. Mr. Staetter objects to the conditions and sought an absolute discharge before the Review Board one year later. [9] On August 4, 2021, the Review Board held its annual review hearing, reviewing the conditional discharge made a year earlier. Although Mr. Staetter asked for an absolute discharge, it decided to continue the conditional discharge. This is the decision under appeal. [10] The conditions that Mr. Staetter is subject to are set out in the disposition order made August 13, 2021. In summary, although he is able to live in the community, he remains under reporting requirements and the direction and supervision of the Director of Adult Forensic Psychiatric Services (the “Director”). This means he must report as required and if his condition deteriorates he may be required to return to the FPH. He is prohibited from acquiring or possessing any weapon or consuming any illicit substance such as non‑prescription drugs or alcohol, and his compliance with this may be monitored by urinalysis. He is also prohibited from having any direct or indirect contact with his victims or being found within a certain geographic range of Whistler, where the offences against those victims took place. [11] This disposition is reviewable within 12 months, pursuant to s. 672.81 of the Criminal Code . [12] In his written submissions on appeal, Mr. Staetter asks that this Court allow the appeal by substituting an absolute discharge, and, in addition, ordering a new trial of the underlying offences that led to him being found NCRMD. In his oral submissions, Mr. Staetter says that he will be content with a conditional discharge if this Court changes the conditions to allow for three things: that he not be required to take any psychiatric drugs, which he describes as poison and as giving him bad side effects; that he be allowed to use marijuana, which he describes as his medicine and also as part of his religion; and that he be allowed to go to Whistler because that is where his tattoo artist resides. In other words, the only condition remaining of the conditional discharge would essentially be that he have no contact with the victims. He would also remain under the authority of the Review Board. [13] Let me deal briefly with Mr. Staetter’s request to appeal his NCRMD verdict from October 2012 and to seek a new trial: this request is not properly before this Court in this appeal from the Review Board decision. That relief cannot be granted and I will not address it further. [14] With respect to Mr. Staetter’s appeal, the Supreme Court of Canada summarized the proper approach in R. v. Owen , 2003 SCC 33, as follows: 22 An individual who is found to have committed a criminal act or omission under the influence of a mental disorder is not acquitted. Rather, if it is concluded that the mental disorder impaired his or her capacity at the time of the offence to appreciate the nature and quality of what was done or omitted, or of knowing that it was wrong, he or she must be adjudged by the court to be “not criminally responsible [NCR] on account of mental disorder” ( Cr. C. , ss. 16(1) and 672.34). 23 There is no presumption that an NCR individual is a danger to the safety of the public: Winko, supra , at para. 46. On the contrary, the Criminal Code requires that persons found NCR be granted an absolute discharge unless the court or a Review Board is able to conclude that the individual poses a significant risk to the safety of the public. Even when this risk is established, the disposition is to be “the least onerous and least restrictive to the accused” consistent with the level of risk posed, i.e., ranging from detention “in custody in a hospital” to discharge “subject to such conditions as the court or Review Board considers appropriate” ( Cr. C. , s. 672.54). 24 The disposition of a Review Board is subject to appeal to the appellate courts based on “a transcript of the proceedings and any other evidence that the court of appeal finds necessary to admit in the interests of justice” ( Cr. C. , s. 672.73(1)). 25 It is of central importance to the constitutional validity of this statutory arrangement that the individual, who by definition did not at the time of the offence appreciate what he or she was doing, or that it was wrong, be confined only for reasons of public protection, not punishment ( Winko, supra , at paras. 41 and 71, and R. v. Swain , [1991] 1 S.C.R. 933 ). [15] Section 672.78(1) of the Criminal Code gives this Court the power to allow an appeal from a Review Board decision on three grounds: (a) the decision is unreasonable and cannot be supported by the evidence; (b) it is based on a wrong decision on a question of law; or (c) there was a miscarriage of justice. [16] The only ground that is relevant to this appeal is s. 672.78(1)(a). For this ground, the standard of review is reasonableness. This Court should decline to intervene unless the Review Board decision was unreasonable in the sense of not being supported by reasons that can bear even a somewhat probing examination: Owen at para. 33. Appellate intervention is limited because the Review Board’s assessment of the offender’s possible dangerousness and the treatment necessary to manage that risk in the community requires specialized knowledge, and the courts generally do not have that expertise: Gibson v. British Columbia (Adult Forensic Psychiatric Services) , 2021 BCCA 210 at paras. 5–6. The task of this Court is to determine whether the Review Board reached an “acceptable and defensible outcome”: Gibson at para. 17, citing Nelson v. British Columbia (Adult Forensic Psychiatric Services) , 2017 BCCA 40 at para. 24. [17] The Review Board correctly stated that its task was to identify whether Mr. Staetter is a significant threat to public safety, in the sense that he poses a risk of serious physical or psychological harm to members of the public resulting from conduct that is criminal in nature but not necessarily violent. [18] There was evidence at the hearing from Mr. Staetter, and from his community treatment team, including his psychiatrist, Dr. Oswald, and case manager, Mr. Bekar. [19] The Review Board found that there had been no meaningful change in Mr. Staetter’s mental status over the last year. The Review Board found that he continues to adhere to his entrenched delusions and remains without any insight into his circumstances. He adamantly insists that psychiatric medication is poison and has repeatedly asked for a reduction or discontinuation of his medication. The Review Board observed that Mr. Staetter repeatedly seeks a prescription for cannabis and believes use of this will create a utopian world. [20] The Review Board noted at paras. 11–14: [11] Dr. Oswald observed that the accused has continued to endorse an expansive and complex delusional system. This includes the belief of having an alter ego named “Eli” and engaging in fantastic activities such as teleportation. The accused thinks that the victim has shape shifting abilities and has described having “killed” her when she was a different male person. Dr. Oswald noted that in the past the accused has said that he is Jesus Christ and has described Whistler (the municipality where the victim resided) as “New Jerusalem.” [12] Significantly, the accused continues to adhere to the delusions that motivated him to commit the index offences. He remains focused on overturning his NCRMD verdict, claiming that his trial was a mockery of justice, that the trial judge will receive her just desserts in the future, and that he was “denied a defence.” The accused does not conceal that if absolutely discharged, his first action would be to contact the victim. [13] Notwithstanding the accused’s overt symptomatology, he has remained behaviourally settled. He has continued to live at Johnson Manor without significant problem. He has worked part‑time as a dishwasher and remains interested in pursuing similar employment. Although it is unclear how the accused spends the majority of his day, as he has not been willing to share this information, there have been no reports or indication of untoward behaviours. [14] In oral evidence Dr. Oswald confirmed that the accused’s risk was rooted in his elaborate delusional beliefs. He characterized these as worrisome. He reiterated that the accused has stated that if he were absolutely discharged, he would immediately contact the victim in order to exonerate himself. Dr. Oswald observed that the accused’s delusions are not encapsulated and have continued to evolve and incorporate new material. He acknowledged that despite the accused’s entrenched beliefs, he had demonstrated a capacity to conform his behaviour to the treatment team’s expectations. He explained that the accused was strongly motivated to avoid further return to FPH. [21] The Review Board considered the evidence that Mr. Staetter has during the review period remained compliant with treatment and supervision, but, in Dr. Oswald’s opinion, this was assisted by the medication and motivated only by Mr. Staetter’s wish to avoid involuntary return to FPH (see paras. 9, 13, 14). Dr. Oswald stated in his report that, based on Mr. Staetter’s history, if he discontinued treatment, “this would lead to significant mental deterioration with the development of expanded delusions”. In that scenario, “Mr. Staetter’s risk for violence, including criminal harassment, would be high.” [22] The Review Board noted Dr. Oswald’s opinion of Mr. Staetter’s risk was that his most likely form of future violence would be harassment, although it was “conceivable that Mr. Staetter’s aggression could escalate to physical violence” (at para. 23). [23] Mr. Bekar’s evidence was consistent with Dr. Oswald’s evidence. [24] Mr. Staetter testified that he was not psychotic and did not have delusions. He insisted that he did not have a fair trial and that he did not threaten P.H. His written submissions repeated many of his delusions. [25] The Review Board concluded that there was little doubt that if absolutely discharged without the conditions, Mr. Staetter would act upon his delusions and pose a real risk to P.H. and persons associated with her. Based on all of the circumstances, the Review Board concluded that Mr. Staetter remained a significant threat to public safety (at para. 24). [26] Concerning disposition, the Review Board noted that the Director and the Crown agreed that Mr. Staetter’s risk was manageable under the conditions imposed on the conditional discharge. The Board noted that it is likely that the injectable psychiatric medication taken by Mr. Staetter has attenuated his beliefs enough so that he does not act on them. The Review Board found no merit to Mr. Staetter’s request to delete all conditions except the no contact provisions (at para. 25), a request similar to the one made orally on this appeal. [27] Accordingly, the Review Board made a conditional discharge on the same conditions as the previous disposition. [28] In my view, the reasons of the Review Board show that it carefully considered all of the evidence before it and found the evidence to support the conclusion that Mr. Staetter remains resistant to treatment, psychotic and delusional, and that he poses a real risk to the victims and other members of the public unless he is managed in the community by way of the conditions placed on his discharge. [29] Mr. Staetter’s main complaint appears to be directed towards the continued administration of psychiatric medication and the condition that he not take non‑prescription drugs such as marijuana. While he has not behaved dangerously over the past year, the Review Board considered Dr. Oswald’s opinion that Mr. Staetter’s adherence to treatment was only as a result of the deterrent effect of involuntary return to FPH if he discontinued treatment. [30] Although Mr. Staetter strongly opposes any conditions imposed on him, his evidence and submissions at the review hearing and his submissions on appeal, when viewed objectively, are consistent with Dr. Oswald’s evidence. [31] The Review Board concluded that, if released, Mr. Staetter will likely discontinue the psychiatric medication that has helped him make progress in his treatment so far, and he would thereby pose a real risk to P.H. or other persons, and so imposed conditions on Mr. Staetter’s discharge that were the least onerous and least restrictive disposition consistent with public safety. Applying the standard under the Criminal Code , I am of the view that the Review Board’s decision is neither unreasonable nor unsupported by the evidence. [32] For these reasons, I am of the view there is no basis for interfering with the Review Board’s decision. [33] I would dismiss the appeal. [34] SAUNDERS J.A. : I agree. [35] ABRIOUX J.A. : I agree. [36] SAUNDERS J.A. : The appeal is dismissed. “The Honourable Madam Justice Griffin”"},"meta":{},"created_at":"2022-03-03T02:25:43.697204Z","updated_at":"2022-03-07T17:58:08.741522Z","project":1},{"id":22,"annotations":[{"id":28,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"start":3,"end":40,"text":"THE SUPREME COURT OF BRITISH COLUMBIA","labels":["COURT_NAME"]},"id":"okMjV5ciVk","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":51,"end":83,"text":"Rizzuto v.

Grover, 2021 BCSC 619 Date: 20210106 Docket: E54267 Registry: New Westminster Between: Garth Alexander Rizzuto Claimant And Susan Marie Grover Respondent Before: The Honourable Mr. Justice Ball Oral Reasons for Judgment In Chambers The Claimant, appearing on his own behalf via teleconference: G.A. Rizzuto Counsel for the Respondent appearing via teleconference: R.A. Henderson Place and Date of Hearing: New Westminster, B.C. January 6, 2021 Place and Date of Judgment: New Westminster, B.C. January 6, 2021 [1] THE COURT: This is an application which has been brought by the respondent, Susan Marie Grover, for an order that the claimant post the sum of $23,000.00 on account of security for costs for the respondent and to impose a time limit for the posting of security for costs. [2] This matter has a long history, but not much has happened. It is a long history in the sense that there has been some delay. Originally, the action was brought as a family law claim, but that matter was litigated before the Honourable Mr. Justice Harvey. The hearing was on March 6, 2020, and the judgment was ultimately rendered on October 23, 2020. At that time, having reviewed the affidavits of the parties as a summary trial matter, Mr. Justice Harvey ordered that the parties were not spouses as that is defined in the Family Law Act . As a result that portion of the claim had to fail. [3] The other issue which Mr. Justice Harvey dealt with related to the Certificates of Pending Litigation (“CPL”) that had been filed by the claimant against two properties called the “Cedar Bowl Crescent properties”. The Cedar Bowl Crescent properties had been purchased with monies, from everything I can see in the material that is filed, that came exclusively from the respondent, based on the sale of her own property in Burnaby. Subsequently, using the proceeds of sale of the Burnaby property, she purchased the two Cedar Bowl Crescent properties, one of which had a home on it; the other property was empty land. [4] There are some complications, in that the company owned apparently by Mr. Rizzuto brought proceedings in the Small Claims Division and then abandoned certain parts of his claim for monies he said he spent on construction. There is great dispute and debate over that, as the respondent takes the position that she had to pay many bills twice. Those issues were not before the court on this application. [5] But, in any event, the reasons given by Mr. Justice Harvey, Rizzuto v. Grover , 2020 BCSC 1564, which are extensive, state at para. 114, as follows: Finally, I am not convinced of the strength of the claimant’s argument for a property interest in the Cedar Bowl Crescent properties. I have considered the, albeit disputed, evidence tendered by the claimant supporting his claim for a constructive trust . . . Then the court goes on and says that Mr. Justice Harvey was not going to deal with the claim for constructive trust, but, at the same time, he ordered the removal of the CPLs from those two properties, the result being that the respondent was free to deal with them. [6] An issue that remained alive in this proceeding was a claim in trust. There was no document nor written agreement with respect to such a claim relating to either the purchase by Ms. Grover of the property with any of the vendors or any agreement with the claimant here. The claimant simply says “I think we were in a trust relationship\". The claimant’s thoughts are insufficient to found a claim in trust. [7] Speaking to the respondent’s application for security for costs, Supreme Court Family Rule 22-1(6) provides the court a discretion to make an order for security for costs. In respect to an individual, that discretion is to be exercised carefully and with a high threshold, where security for costs are sought against an individual. [8] In this case, there is a claim in trust by the plaintiff, which is unsupported by any documentation and which claim has already been, in part, ruled against by Mr. Justice Harvey. The Court there made and expression of the lack of strength of the claimant's argument with respect to the Cedar Bowl Crescent properties. Harvey J. certainly was not satisfied it was a strong claim. [9] In those circumstances, this is a case which meets that high threshold. Counsel for the respondent provided a draft calculation of costs for a trial for five days, based on a matter of ordinary difficulty. The draft totals over $23,000.00. I am satisfied that the respondent is entitled to an order that the claimant post the sum of $23,000.00 on account of security for costs and that that sum shall be posted with the court within 60 days from today. The claimant will also have her costs of this hearing today. [10] The Court also orders that Mr. Rizzuto’s signature may be dispensed with on the order herein on the agreement by counsel to provide him with a copy of the order as soon as it is entered.

Held: Application granted. The proposed release plan is sufficient to protect public safety. [1] BENNETT J.A. : Phillip Tallio brings his second application for judicial interim release pending appeal. For the reasons that follow, I would grant the application. [2] On August 9, 2019, I refused Mr. Tallio’s first application in reasons indexed at 2019 BCCA 300. These reasons should be read in conjunction with those reasons. My main concern when I refused release was that the facility where he planned to reside could not provide sufficient supervision for him. [3] The Crown opposes his release. [4] This application is based on the John Howard Society accepting Mr. Tallio into one of its facilities. I have a complete affidavit, and heard evidence regarding the sufficiency of the supervision and programming available. I am satisfied that the John Howard Society will provide sufficient supervision of Mr. Tallio to protect the public safety. As a result, I am satisfied that the requirements for judicial interim release found in s. 679(3) of the Criminal Code , R.S.C. 1985, c. C‑46 have been met. In order to satisfy the public safety aspect of the public interest component, a number of conditions will be imposed as terms of his release. The conditions have generally been agreed to by the parties. [5] Thus, I order Mr. Tallio’s release on a recognizance in the amount of $10,000 without deposit or surety with the following conditions: a) You must keep the peace and be of good behaviour. b) You must report to a bail supervisor no later than January 10, 2020 at Abbotsford Community Corrections at 2865 Cruickshank Street, Abbotsford, British Columbia, and thereafter once per week in person, or otherwise as directed by your bail supervisor. c) You must reside at [residence name and address redacted], Abbotsford, British Columbia. You must abide by all of the rules and regulations required by [the residence]. If you are expelled from [the residence], or no longer reside there for any reason, you will surrender forthwith into police custody. d) You are to go directly to [the residence] upon your release, in the company of your lawyer, a John Howard Society staff member or a Correctional Service of Canada employee. e) You shall not leave the Province of British Columbia. f) You will notify your bail supervisor and seek their permission before participating in any volunteer activity or obtaining employment. If you are granted permission by the bail supervisor to volunteer or work, you will provide a copy of this release document to a supervisor of the volunteer organization and\/or your employer.

Stevic, 2022 BCCA 45 Date: 20220131 Docket: CA47544 Between: Regina Respondent And Jugoslav Stevic Appellant Before: The Honourable Madam Justice Bennett The Honourable Madam Justice Stromberg‑Stein The Honourable Madam Justice Fisher On appeal from: An order of the Provincial Court of British Columbia, dated May 13, 2021 (sentence) ( R. v. Stevic , Vancouver Docket 256892‑1). Oral Reasons for Judgment The Appellant, appearing in person (via videoconference): J. Stevic Counsel for the Respondent (via videoconference): L.A. Chu Place and Date of Hearing: Vancouver, British Columbia January 31, 2022 Place and Date of Judgment: Vancouver, British Columbia January 31, 2022 Summary: Appeal from a sentence of fines and a restitution order for fraud and uttering a forged document following a joint submission. Held: Appeal dismissed. Appellate intervention is not justified in this case. The appellant has not demonstrated the sentence was demonstrably unfit or the judge committed an error of principle that impacted the sentence by failing to make an in‑depth inquiry into his ability to pay in the face of a joint submission on sentencing. STROMBERG-STEIN J.A. : [1] Jugoslav Stevic appeals his sentence of a fine and a restitution order following his guilty pleas to fraud and uttering a forged document. Notwithstanding the sentence was a joint submission by Crown and defence counsel, he submits the sentence was excessive because the judge did not consider his ability to pay. For the reasons that follow, I would dismiss the appeal. [2] Mr. Stevic is 61 years old. He has health problems. In 2011, he began to receive provincial disability assistance of approximately $1,450.50 per month. He was employed as a school bus driver. [3] In 2016, Mr. Stevic was involved in a car accident. He applied for temporary total disability (TTD) benefits, which are payable to individuals rendered incapable of working as a result of accident injuries. He received approximately $300 per week from April 13, 2016, to October 1, 2018, from the Insurance Corporation of British Columbia (ICBC). Mr. Stevic was not entitled to a large portion of these benefits as he continued working as a bus driver during most of this period of time, and he was on seasonal layoff when school was not in session. [4] To facilitate his fraudulent receipt of TTD benefits, Mr. Stevic forged a company signature on a certificate of earnings. [5] He has been unemployed since September 2018, and claims he has no other income or savings. However, when an ICBC investigator interviewed Mr. Stevic on October 1, 2018, he offered to give the money back to ICBC. He has no other criminal record. [6] On February 10, 2021, Mr. Stevic entered guilty pleas on two counts: fraud over $5,000 and uttering a forged document. Pursuant to s. 738(1) of the Criminal Code , R.S.C. 1985, c. C‑46, the Crown sought a restitution order in the amount of $14,414.28. This amount was disputed. [7] On May 13, 2021, there was a Gardiner hearing to determine the amount of the fraud. An ICBC representative and Mr. Stevic testified. However, over the lunch break, Crown and defence counsel reached an agreement for a joint submission on sentence, which included restitution in the amount of $12,000 and a fine of $3,500, split between the two counts. [8] The judge’s reasons are sparse. He declined to hear submissions on Mr. Stevic’s antecedents, indicating it was his practice to follow a joint submission “unless there is some good reason not to do so.” He also commented that the lawyers were experienced. [9] When defence counsel said he doubted Mr. Stevic could pay the victim surcharge, the judge waived it. When the judge asked Mr. Stevic if he wanted one year to pay the fine, Mr. Stevic answered in the affirmative and added something, which is indicated as inaudible in the transcript. To this, the judge replied, “[i]t sounds like you are going to be struggling a wee bit.” In asking for as much time to pay as the court was willing to give, defence counsel explained Mr. Stevic was unemployed and was probably going to remain so for the foreseeable future. The judge granted Mr. Stevic one year, to May 31, 2022, to pay the fine. He explained that if Mr. Stevic could not pay the fine, and it posed a hardship, Mr. Stevic could apply for an extension of time to pay. The judge informed Mr. Stevic he could face a further charge, potentially resulting in a jail sentence, if he did not pay the fine and did not seek an extension. The judge was satisfied Mr. Stevic acknowledged the terms and conditions of the fine. [10] With respect to the restitution order, the judge erroneously told Mr. Stevic that if he did not pay, there was a potential for a jail sentence. However, in my view, nothing turns on this. [11] The standard of appellate review on sentence appeals is highly deferential. Intervention is justified when an appellate court identifies a material error in principle that has impacted the sentence or the sentence is demonstrably unfit. A demonstrably unfit sentence is a sentence that is “clearly unreasonable”, “clearly or manifestly excessive”, or one that represents a “substantial and marked departure” from typical sentences. Where intervention is justified, an appellate court will perform its own sentencing analysis, showing deference to the judge’s findings that are untainted by error: R. v. Lacasse, 2015 SCC 64 at paras. 41–44, 52–53; R. v. Friesen, 2020 SCC 9 at paras. 25–29. Restitution orders are subject to the same standard of appellate review: R. v. Dunkers, 2018 BCCA 363 at para. 14. [12] Mr. Stevic appeals his sentence on the basis that it is excessive. I assume he means the sentence is demonstrably unfit. He also seems to allege an error in principle. His factum appears to focus on the fine, but the remedy Mr. Stevic seeks is a “reassessment of the fine and restitution amounts” because the judge erred in failing to properly apply s. 734(2) of the Criminal Code by not satisfying himself Mr. Stevic could pay. [13] There are a number of overlapping areas of the law at play in this case. Judges are not bound to accept joint submissions, but the test for departing from a joint submission is high: “whether the proposed sentence would bring the administration of justice into disrepute, or would otherwise be contrary to the public interest”: R. v. Anthony‑Cook , 2016 SCC 43 at para. 5. Judges are presumed to know the law, so in this case, the judge’s comment—that his practice was to accept joint submissions “unless there is some good reason not to do so”—is presumed to mean he considered the public interest test in Anthony‑Cook . [14] A judge cannot impose a fine unless satisfied, on a balance of probabilities, the accused is able to pay. Section 734(2) of the Criminal Code provides: Except when the punishment for an offence includes a minimum fine or a fine is imposed in lieu of a forfeiture order, a court may fine an offender under this section only if the court is satisfied that the offender is able to pay the fine or discharge it under section 736. [15] A judge must make an affirmative finding based on proper evidence: R. v. Topp , 2011 SCC 43 at paras. 21, 24. However, in line with the reasoning in Anthony‑Cook , in my view, the sentencing judge is entitled to rely on the joint submission of counsel when considering the accused’s ability to pay. [16] Where there is past receipt of illegally obtained funds, a judge may infer the accused has the ability to pay a fine in the absence of a reasonable explanation that they no longer possess their ill‑gotten gains: Topp at para. 7. A judge may also make this inference if they have sufficient financial information, obtain the assurance of counsel, or consider the conduct of the accused: R. v. S.W.M. , 2010 BCCA 86 at para. 20; R. v. United States of America (2004), 71 O.R. (3d) 141 at para. 37, 184 C.C.C. (3d) 427 (S.C.); R. v. Shin , 2015 ONCA 189 at paras. 108–128. [17] On appeal, Mr. Stevic claims he is unable to pay the fine. He submits he had little time over the lunch hour to consider the joint submission, even though he agreed to it in court. In particular, Mr. Stevic suggests the judge committed a reversible error by failing to sufficiently inquire into Mr. Stevic’s financial circumstances to determine his ability to pay the fine prior to imposing the sentence. Had the judge done so, he would have realized Mr. Stevic did not have sufficient means to pay the fine and should then have exercised his discretion to refuse to accept the joint submission. Moreover, Mr. Stevic asserts the judge should have realized this inquiry was necessary because he acknowledged Mr. Stevic would struggle to pay the fine, granted him a year to pay, and noted Mr. Stevic could apply for an extension. [18] I would not accede to the arguments of Mr. Stevic. I would note Mr. Stevic does not say his financial position has changed since the fine was imposed. Nor has he applied to extend the time to pay his fine or made any effort to pay anything toward the fine. He was represented by counsel at the hearing. He agreed to the joint submission in court. In the circumstances, the judge was not required to make a specific inquiry about Mr. Stevic’s ability to pay. Rather, the judge was entitled to rely on the joint submission and the assurance of experienced counsel to infer that Mr. Stevic was willing and able to pay the fine. [19] Restitution orders are not subject to s. 734(2): Topp at para. 38. Nonetheless, while the accused’s ability to pay restitution is not a precondition to making a restitution order, it is an important factor a judge must weigh and consider, and not merely note: R. v. Robertson , 2020 ONCA 367 at para. 8; R. v. Sawchuk , 2021 BCCA 74 at para. 16; R. v. Abdulahi‑Sabet , 2020 BCCA 213 at para. 13. [20] However, where the offence involves a breach of trust, or is theft ‑ related and stolen money is unaccounted for, the accused’s ability to pay is given little weight. The inverse is also true. In these circumstances, it is important to account for what happened to the money: Abdulahi‑Sabet at paras. 14–15. [21] A restitution order should be made with restraint and caution, should bear in mind the principle of totality, and should not be a mechanical afterthought: Abdulahi‑Sabet at para. 12. [22] In this case, given the fact that the fruits of the fraud have not been accounted for and the evidence before the judge on the joint submission, the judge’s stand‑alone restitution order was entirely appropriate. Mr. Stevic’s ability to pay was (and is) not entitled to much weight in the circumstances. Further, it is clear the judge considered the joint submission and he did not simply add a restitution order as a mechanical afterthought. The restitution order is enforceable as a civil judgment, with no prescribed time to pay. [23] Mr. Stevic agreed to pay the fine and he agreed to the restitution order. He told the ICBC investigator he was willing to pay the money back. The money remains unaccounted for. [24] Appellate intervention is not justified in this case. Mr. Stevic has not met the high threshold of demonstrating the sentence imposed was demonstrably unfit. Nor has he shown the judge committed an error of principle that impacted the sentence by failing to make an in‑depth inquiry into his ability to pay in the face of a joint submission on sentencing. [25] I would note that even for a first‑time offender, in my view, Mr. Stevic’s sentence could be considered lenient. The relevant principles of sentencing are denunciation and deterrence for fraud offences. The circumstances of this case could easily have attracted a custodial sentence of several months: R. v. Kodimyala , 2020 BCCA 275. [26] I would grant leave to appeal, but would dismiss the appeal. [27] BENNETT J.A. : I agree. [28] FISHER J.A. : I agree. [29] BENNETT J.A. : Leave to appeal is granted, but the appeal is dismissed. “The Honourable Madam Justice Stromberg‑Stein”"},"meta":{},"created_at":"2022-03-03T02:25:43.696977Z","updated_at":"2022-03-05T07:47:52.862368Z","project":1},{"id":19,"annotations":[{"id":25,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"start":3,"end":40,"text":"THE SUPREME COURT OF BRITISH COLUMBIA","labels":["COURT_NAME"]},"id":"KpbpVVswT2","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":51,"end":78,"text":"R. v.

THE SUPREME COURT OF BRITISH COLUMBIA Citation: R. v. Smith, 2019 BCSC 1152 Date: 20190111 Docket: X079843 Registry: New Westminster Regina v. Stephen Smith Before: The Honourable Mr. Justice Riley Oral Ruling re Application for Additional Information (Re: Accused Stephen Smith) Counsel for the Crown: S.D. Smith C. Karlsson Counsel for the Accused Smith: M.J. Swartz Place and Date of Hearing: New Westminster, B.C. January 11, 2019 Place and Date of Judgment: New Westminster, B.C. January 11, 2019 [1] THE COURT: We are in the midst of the Crown's reply submissions at Mr. Smith's sentencing. In the course of the reply submissions, counsel for Mr. Smith has made a request for the court to seek out or obtain additional information in a number of areas. Counsel has suggested that this could be done either by ordering a further presentence report, with a direction that certain matters be included or addressed in the report, or by granting an adjournment to allow Mr. Smith to obtain the information in question, or finally, in the alternative, by the court, on its own motion, directing the production of additional material under s. 723(3) of the Criminal Code , R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46 [ Code ]. [2] The information in question which drives the defence request falls into, really, two categories: One category is further details, biographical details about Mr. Smith's personal history, and in particular, the history of his time spent in the care of government ministries in Ontario, and the amount of time that he spent in Jamaica with extended family. The second category of information would be information pertaining to systemic racism and discrimination against black people in Canada, and how that might have a bearing upon Mr. Smith's circumstances in this case. [3] I have carefully considered Mr. Smith's proposal to obtain this additional information, but in my view, at this stage in the proceedings, such an approach is not required or warranted. I will point out that earlier in these proceedings, the court had indicated on a number of occasions that the sentencing proceeding would unfold, or the sentencing hearing would unfold in the following way: both parties would be expected to present any evidence they were relying upon, and after that stage of the hearing concluded, each party would then make its arguments about the appropriate disposition, based on the evidence that was adduced, or the facts that were presented. [4] In this context, a presentence report was prepared and made available for the sentencing, and filed as an exhibit at the sentencing hearing. There is a particular portion of that presentence report to which the Crown objected; that portion of the report contains Mr. Smith's recount of the circumstances of the offence, and more specifically, of his involvement in the offence. The Crown objected to that, and it was common ground that because the Crown objected to it, it was inadmissible. Mr. Smith then sought a ruling from the court allowing him to give evidence about that subject matter, and the court, after hearing extensive argument, ruled in Mr. Smith's favour, that he would be allowed to give evidence about his specific role in the offence. Ultimately, Mr. Smith made a decision not to do so, not to give evidence about his role in the offence, and that was the end of that matter. [5] The sentencing hearing proceeded. The Crown presented all of its evidence at sentencing, which included some material about Mr. Smith's background, and more specifically, about his time in custody, and his conduct while in custody. The defence also presented evidence at the sentencing hearing, most specifically, Mr. Smith himself testified, and addressed some of the material that had been filed by the Crown with respect to his conduct while in custody. Mr. Smith also gave further information about his upbringing and his background, and his time in the care of government ministries in Ontario. Mr. Smith was also cross-examined on his testimony. [6] After all of that evidence was placed before the court, the evidentiary portion of the sentencing hearing concluded, and we began submissions. [7] In the course of the Crown's submissions, the Crown, effectively, took the following positions with respect to the two categories of information. [8] First, with respect to the biographical information, the information about Mr. Smith's background, and, in particular, the information in the presentence report, the Crown did not take issue with the admissibility of Mr. Smith's statements in the presentence report, but the Crown did argue that the information in the presentence report was vague, and the court should take that into account in assessing the weight or the quality of the information in the report, insofar as it emanated from Mr. Smith. [9] With respect to the issue of racial discrimination in Canada, and, in particular, its significance in Mr. Smith's case, the Crown has said in submissions this afternoon, that the Crown is not disputing Mr. Smith's testimony with regard to his personal experience and his perceptions of the discrimination that he has been subjected to. The Crown's focus, in its argument, is on the extent to which that background is related to, or linked to the offences for which he is now being sentenced. [10] At the end of the day, there has to be some finality, and some end to the evidentiary inquiry for the purposes of sentencing. Both parties made decisions about what evidence they would present, and were accorded fair notice of what was in issue, and what was disputed, and what was not disputed. The Crown's position about the quality of the biographical information, and the extent of detail of the biographical information in the report, and about the relevance of racial discrimination, and how those issues relate to the sentencing in Mr. Smith's case, would not have been really a surprise to Mr. Smith. It is not a question of saying that the evidence presented by Mr. Smith was objected to as being inadmissible; it is a question of the Crown arguing what weight the court should attach to it, which is a function of argument, and would always be permitted. [11] In the end, I am not satisfied that it would be of real benefit to the court to adjourn the proceedings and occasion further delay in the conclusion of this case, in order to get more information, when each party had the opportunity to present the information earlier in the proceedings, and when the court now has a fair bit of information, including testimony from Mr. Smith himself about the two issues in question. In the end, I am not going to accede to Mr. Smith's request to order a further presentence report, or to adjourn to obtain more information, or to direct the production of additional material with respect to the matters that he has referred to in his request. “Riley J.”"},"meta":{},"created_at":"2022-03-03T02:25:43.696888Z","updated_at":"2022-03-05T07:32:55.114755Z","project":1},{"id":18,"annotations":[{"id":24,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"start":0,"end":24,"text":"COURT OF APPEAL OF YUKON","labels":["COURT_NAME"]},"id":"cm7O_1YgVi","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":35,"end":59,"text":"R. v.

Larue, 2020 YKCA 1 Date: 20200127 Docket: 13-YU727 Between: Regina Respondent And Norman Eli Larue Appellant Before: The Honourable Madam Justice Bennett The Honourable Madam Justice Dickson The Honourable Madam Justice Charbonneau Reasons for Judgment on the application made in writing to re-open the appeal. The Appellant, acting on his own behalf: (written submissions): N.E. Larue Counsel for the Respondent: N. Sinclair Written Submissions Received: December 20, 2019 Place and Date of Judgment: Vancouver, British Columbia January 27, 2020 Written Reasons of the Court Summary: Application to re-open appeal. Held: Dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. Reasons for Judgment of the Court: [1] Norman Larue was convicted of first degree murder on July 3, 2013. His appeal to this Court was dismissed on June 13, 2018. The reasons are indexed at 2018 YKCA 9. The formal order was entered on August 22, 2018. His appeal to the SCC was dismissed on April 25, 2019. [2] He has filed an application in writing seeking to have his appeal in this Court re-opened, and wishes to raise grounds of appeal that were not argued in the first appeal. [3] Mr. Larue filed a similar application for a rehearing with the Supreme Court of Canada, which was dismissed on October 1, 2019. [4] He notified the registry in Yukon that he has additional material to file, however, given our decision on the jurisdictional point, we have concluded that there is nothing further to be considered that would alter the outcome. [5] In our view this Court does not have jurisdiction to re-open the appeal. For the reasons that follow, we would refuse the application. [6] If an appeal has been determined on its merits and the order has been entered, the Court is functus officio : R. v. Garcha , 2000 BCCA 550 at para. 9; R. v. Hummel , 2003 YKCA 4 at para. 15; R. v. Purdy , 2010 BCCA 413. Appellate courts across Canada are unified in this regard: see, for example R. v. H. (E.F.) (1997), 115 C.C.C. (3d) 89 (Ont. C.A.) at para. 33 [ Rhingo ]; R. v. Akinbiyi , 2008 SKCA 92 at para. 9; R. c. Balafrej (2005), 197 C.C.C. (3d) 88 (Que. C.A.) at paras. 25–27. [7] The reason the Court of Appeal lacks jurisdiction to entertain a re-hearing flows from the exceptional nature of an appeal as a creature of statute. In criminal cases, appeal rights exist by virtue of statutory authority only—an appellate tribunal has no inherent or ancillary jurisdiction to hear a criminal appeal. [8] In exceptional circumstances, this Court has jurisdiction to entertain a request to re-open an appeal when the formal order has not yet been entered. Such an extraordinary power is to be exercised rarely, and only if the applicant can demonstrate a clear and compelling case that a miscarriage of justice will result if the proposed arguments are not considered: Hummel at para. 29. However, that is not the case here. As noted, the order was entered. [9] There are sound policy reasons supporting the reticence towards re-opening appeals that have already been heard on the merits. In Rhingo , Charron J.A. (as she then was) had this to say: 34 …An unlimited discretion to reopen appeals that have been heard on their merits is not only unjustifiable as an ancillary power of the court, but would do significant harm to the criminal justice system. Finality is an important goal of the criminal process. Statutory rights of appeal provide a carefully crafted exception to the general rule that trial decisions are final. By providing broad fights of appellate review in criminal matters, Parliament recognizes that fairness and justice interests require that the accused have a full opportunity to challenge a conviction even though that opportunity will prolong the process. Once those broad appellate rights have been exercised and the merits of the appeal decided, then absent an appeal to a higher court, finality concerns must become paramount. Those affected by the process should be entitled to rely on the appellate decision and conduct themselves accordingly. The appellate process cannot become or even appear to become a never closing revolving door through with appellants come and go whenever they propose to argue a new ground of appeal. [Emphasis added.] [10] Mr. Larue was convicted of first degree murder, which is an indictable offence. Sections 675(1) and 691(1) of the Criminal Code provide an accused’s substantive rights of appeal against a conviction in proceedings by indictment. However, s. 674 explicitly limits appeal rights in relation to indictable offences to the parameters set out in Parts XXI and XXVI: No proceedings other than those authorized by this Part and Part XXVI shall be taken by way of appeal in proceedings in respect of indictable offences. [11] Accordingly, once Mr. Larue’s conviction appeal was dismissed on its merits and an order was entered, his statutory rights in this Court became exhausted. Any remaining appeal rights anchored in the Criminal Code were extinguished when the Supreme Court of Canada pronounced judgment on April 25, 2019. In effect, a subsequent “reopening of the same proceeding would involve the creation of further substantive or procedural rights, which only Parliament can enact”: Rhingo at para. 33. [12] Mr. Larue may nonetheless apply for Ministerial review under Part XXI.1 of the Criminal Code . These provisions allow for an application to be made to the Minister of Justice for a review of the case on the basis of a miscarriage of justice, once a person’s appeal rights have been exhausted. Mr. Larue’s letter indicates that he has in fact initiated this process. [13] The application is refused. “The Honourable Madam Justice Bennett” “The Honourable Madam Justice Dickson” “The Honourable Madam Justice Charbonneau”"},"meta":{},"created_at":"2022-03-03T02:25:43.696829Z","updated_at":"2022-03-05T06:34:12.679414Z","project":1},{"id":17,"annotations":[{"id":23,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"start":0,"end":36,"text":"COURT OF APPEAL FOR BRITISH COLUMBIA","labels":["COURT_NAME"]},"id":"X0gISeMg5I","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":47,"end":77,"text":"R. v.

Restriction on publication: Pursuant to s. 16(4) of the Sex Offender Information and Registration Act [ SOIRA ], no person shall disclose any information that is collected pursuant to an order under SOIRA or the fact that information relating to a person is collected under SOIRA . Before: The Honourable Madam Justice Saunders (In Chambers) On appeal from: An order of the Supreme Court of British Columbia, dated May 16, 2018 ( R. v. Czechowski , 2018 BCSC 1646 , Kelowna Docket 84432-2 ). Oral Reasons for Judgment Counsel for the Appellant (via teleconference): M.A. Nathanson Counsel for the Respondent (via teleconference): M. Vojvodic Place and Date of Hearing: Vancouver, British Columbia January 4, 2021 Place and Date of Judgment: Vancouver, British Columbia January 8, 2021 Summary: Application for bail pending disposition of the applicant’s application for leave to appeal from conviction to the Supreme Court of Canada. The application is opposed by the Crown on the basis the applicant has not established that his detention is not necessary in the public interest (s. 679(3)(c) of the Criminal Code). The proposed grounds of appeal relate to this court’s application of the curative proviso in s. 686(1(b)(iii) where two serious errors of law have been identified. Held: Application allowed on terms. The components of the s. 679(3)(c) criterion are public safety and public confidence in the administration of justice. The public confidence component balances enforceability versus reviewability. Given the degree of arguability of the proposed grounds of appeal and their possible national import, the proposed leave to appeal application has sufficient potential to weigh in favour of release. That potential, combined with the ability of strict terms of release to address public safety issues and the character of the proposed appeal as an initial review of the issues raised, favours release pending determination of the leave application. [1] SAUNDERS J.A. : Mr. Czechowski applies pursuant to s. 679(1)(c) of the Criminal Code , R.S.C. 1985, c. C‑46 for judicial interim release (bail) pending his s. 691 application for leave to appeal his convictions to the Supreme Court of Canada. He was convicted at trial by judge alone on May 16, 2018 of four offences arising from a sexual encounter between himself and the complainant in February 2016: sexual assault causing bodily harm, unlawful confinement, attempting to choke or suffocate or strangle, and uttering threats. On April 5, 2019, he was sentenced on these offences to five years’ incarceration, in total. [2] The applicant appealed his convictions to this court. Pending his appeal, he was given judicial interim release, as he had between the time of his conviction and sentencing, and indeed time before his conviction. In August 2020, while this court’s decision on his conviction appeals was reserved, the Crown applied to revoke his bail because he had been charged with uttering threats in an unrelated incident. Mr. Justice Butler dismissed that application in reasons indexed at 2020 BCCA 237, but imposed more restrictive terms of release. [3] The applicant’s conviction appeal was dismissed on October 13, 2020, by reasons indexed as 2020 BCCA 277. [4] The issues at trial related to consent in respect of sexual activity between the applicant and the complainant. The judge accepted the complainant’s testimony that she had not consented to any of the sexual activity and found, in the alternative, that she had no capacity to consent in any event. In so finding, the judge relied upon expert evidence from a medical doctor about the complainant’s memory and referred to the doctor’s evidence of a prior consistent statement made by the complainant at the hospital. The trial record included a body of evidence of physical injuries sustained by the complainant in the encounter, and words said by her in communications between the police and the complainant shortly after she left the residence. [5] Before this court, the applicant raised seven grounds of appeal. This court found that the trial judge had made two serious errors of law, the first in admitting and relying on expert evidence from a physician that went beyond the physician’s expertise, and the second in considering the complainant’s prior consistent statement to the physician. This court then considered the application of the curative proviso under s. 686(1)(b)(iii) of the Criminal Code in the circumstances of the two errors of law identified. This court held that evidence of the injuries to the complainant, the doctor’s assessment of the injuries, and the complainant’s interactions with police immediately after the incident were inconsistent with consensual sex and in conclusion found that circumstantial evidence against the applicant “overwhelmingly established non‑consent” apart from the complainant’s testimony. It dismissed the appeal on the basis conviction would be inevitable upon a retrial. [6] In his application for leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada, the applicant contends that this court has “watered down” the standard applicable in application of the curative proviso, contrary to jurisprudence of the Supreme Court of Canada such as R. v. Sarrazin , 2011 SCC 54 and R. v. Van , 2009 SCC 22. [7] He says that this court selectively looked to evidence that supported the Crown’s case and ignored evidence capable of raising a reasonable doubt, diminishing the high standard for application of the curative proviso and he refers to jurisprudence from other provinces that he says has rejected the use of the proviso in similar circumstances. Further, the applicant contends that this court reversed the onus of proof, contrary to ss. 7 and 11(d) of the Charter and that the results violate his right to a jury trial under s. 11(h) of the Charter . [8] Section 679(3) sets out the criteria that must be established by an applicant to obtain judicial interim release: (3) In the case of an appeal referred to in paragraph (1)(a) or (c), the judge of the court of appeal may order that the appellant be released pending the determination of his appeal if the appellant establishes that (a) the appeal or application for leave to appeal is not frivolous; (b) he will surrender himself into custody in accordance with the terms of the order; and (c) his detention is not necessary in the public interest. [9] Each of these three criteria must be met on a balance of probabilities: R. v. Oland , 2017 SCC 17 at para. 17. [10] On this application, the applicant says that he has met all three criteria. [11] The Crown agrees that the applicant has met the first two criteria, but says that the applicant has not established that his detention is not necessary in the public interest. In particular on the third criterion, the Crown says that application for leave to appeal is fundamentally flawed because it seeks to undermine jurisprudence from the Supreme Court of Canada wherein the curative proviso has been applied to sustain convictions based on a subset of the evidence adduced at trial, and that the applicant has not raised any issues of national importance. [12] I will address the three criteria separately – the first two in short compass. [13] It is accepted that the merits assessment of the first criterion, whether the application is frivolous, is a low bar. On a leave application the merits will include consideration of whether the proposed appeal could be of national importance: R. v. Pires , 2004 BCCA 91. This is in the context, however, of the low bar. [14] In light of the low bar and the articulated proposed grounds of appeal, I am satisfied that the applicant has met this first criterion. [15] The second criterion engages the likelihood that the applicant will surrender himself into custody in accordance with the terms of the order. I agree that on the materials before us, there is ample evidence to satisfy this criterion. [16] The real question before me is whether the applicant has satisfied the third criterion: has he established that his detention while he awaits the decision in his leave application is not necessary in the public interest. [17] There are two components to the third criterion, public safety and public confidence in the administration of justice: Oland at para. 23. The Crown says that the public safety consideration weighs against release because he has been charged with uttering threats that necessitated a further tightening of his bail conditions before this court dismissed his conviction appeal. [18] I recognize this concern but note that the charge of uttering threats is still in early stages of the trial process, and Justice Butler considered the tightened bail conditions sufficiently met the public safety risk that charge indicated. There is no evidence of a failure to meet the tightened conditions. While this feature is troubling, in light of the history in this court on the prior applications I cannot say, by itself, it is determinative. [19] This application therefore comes down to a question of public confidence in the administration of justice. In Oland , the Supreme Court of Canada said, at para. 47, concerning public confidence: [47] ... is to be measured through the eyes of a reasonable member of the public. This person is someone who is thoughtful, dispassionate, informed of the circumstances of the case and respectful of society’s fundamental values. [20] The question of public confidence in turn engages two competing interests which must be balanced, the enforceability interest and the reviewability interest. [21] In R. v. Boima , unreported, (5 November 2018), Vancouver CA44501 (B.C.C.A.), Madam Justice Dickson described enforceability and reviewability in these terms: [21] Enforceability relates to the public interest in the enforcement of judgments and in denying bail to a person convicted of a serious offence. It captures the gravity of the offence, the circumstances surrounding the commission of the offence and the potential length of imprisonment: Oland at para. 38. The fact that an appellate court upheld a guilty verdict means that the pendulum swings towards enforceability and away from bail pending further review: R. v. Drabinsky , 201 1 ONCA 647 at para. 10 (Doherty J.A. in Chambers). [22] Reviewability relates to the public interest in the review and correction of errors in judgments: R. v. Mapara , 2001 BCCA 508 at para. 32. In the appellate context, the strength of the case factor translates into the strength of the grounds of appeal and informs reviewability: Oland at para. 40. Using their experience and knowledge, judges should form a preliminary assessment of the strength of the grounds of appeal to see if they \"clearly surpass the not frivolous standard\": Oland at paras. 44–45. [22] In respect of enforceability, the Supreme Court of Canada in Oland said: [37] In assessing whether public confidence concerns support a pre-trial detention order under s. 515(10)(c), the seriousness of the crime plays an important role. The more serious the crime, the greater the risk that public confidence in the administration of justice will be undermined if the accused is released on bail pending trial. So too for bail pending appeal. In considering the public confidence component under s. 679(3)(c), I see no reason why the seriousness of the crime for which a person has been convicted should not play an equal role in assessing the enforceability interest . [38] With that in mind, I return to s. 515(10)(c), where Parliament has set out three factors by which the seriousness of a crime may be determined: the gravity of the offence, the circumstances surrounding the commission of the offence, and the potential length of imprisonment (s. 515(10)(c)(ii), (iii) and (iv)). In my view, these factors are readily transferable to s. 679(3)(c) — the only difference being that, unlike the pre-trial context, an appeal judge will generally have the trial judge’s reasons for sentence in which the three factors going to the seriousness of the crime will have been addressed. As a rule, the appeal judge need not repeat this exercise . [39] I pause here to note that while the seriousness of the crime for which the offender has been convicted will play an important role in assessing the enforceability interest, other factors should also be taken into account where appropriate. For example, public safety concerns that fall short of the substantial risk mark — which would preclude a release order — will remain relevant under the public confidence component and can, in some cases, tip the scale in favour of detention: R. v. Rhyason , 2006 ABCA 120, 208 C.C.C. (3d) 193, at para. 15; R. v. Roussin , 2011 MBCA 103, 275 Man. R. (2d) 46, at para. 34. The same holds true for lingering flight risks that do not rise to the substantial risk level under s. 679(3)(b). By the same token, the absence of flight or public safety risks will attenuate the enforceability interest. [Emphasis added.] [23] In respect of the reviewability interest, the strength of the appeal or application for leave to appeal is important, beyond the “not frivolous” standard of the first criterion in s. 679(3): see Oland at para. 44; R. v. Porisky , 2012 BCCA 467; R. v. Mapara , 2001 BCCA 508. Here also the level of the legal proceedings is significant. [24] In Drabinsky , Justice Doherty considered an application for judicial interim release of an applicant sentenced to five years’ incarceration on two counts of fraud who had applied to the Supreme Court of Canada for leave to appeal from conviction. All grounds of appeal had been rejected by the appellate court. In dismissing the application for judicial interim release, Justice Doherty gave priority to the enforceability interest in recognition that the grounds of appeal advanced had already been reviewed and rejected on appeal and there was no further right to an appeal. Last, he considered that the length of sentence in that case meant that there would still be a large remainder of the sentence to be served after the leave application was determined. [25] A different result obtained in Boima . In Boima , Madam Justice Dickson observed that the applicant’s application for leave to appeal amounted to an attempt “to push beyond the current boundaries of the law”. She then observed that sometimes boundaries are pushed successfully, and that the length of sentence imposed in the case before her meant that almost all of the sentence would have been served before the leave application would be known. This latter factor weighed strongly in her view that, combined with the absence of a flight risk and the absence of a concern for public safety, the reviewability interest outweighed the enforceability interest. [26] The case before me is between the circumstances of Boima and those of Drabinsky . Unlike Boima , the applicant will not have served all or nearly all of the sentence by the time the leave application is decided. And unlike Drabinsky , not all of the applicant’s grounds of appeal were rejected by this court. Indeed, unlike Drabinsky, in this case two serious errors of law were found before this court applied the curative proviso. By definition the application of the curative proviso, the focus of the applicant’s leave application, has not been the subject of appellate review. [27] I consider that the reviewability interest here has more force in the circumstances of this application than was the case in Drabinsky as this case is more akin to the situation of an appellant advancing his first appeal. As to the merits of the application for leave to appeal, there is difficulty inherent for a justice of this court determining the degree of likelihood that leave to appeal will be granted from a judgment of this court. What I can say is that the grounds of appeal appear to have some substance beyond the non-frivolous standard, and engage issues that the Supreme Court of Canada could consider are of national importance. While I would not dip my toe into predicting the outcome of the application for leave, what I know of the application for leave to appeal suggests it is a real step beyond one “doomed to fail”. [28] I recognize that the offences of which the applicant has been convicted are ones of serious interference with a person. Yet the seriousness of an offence does not preclude bail. Indeed Mapara is a case in which the applicant obtained bail although he had been convicted of first degree murder. [29] On balance, considering the nature of the challenge to this court’s order, I conclude that the reviewability interest marginally outweighs the enforceability interest, and that in the circumstances presented, the applicant has met the requirement of demonstrating that his detention pending determination of his application to the Supreme Court of Canada is not necessary in the public interest, provided that the public safety concerns may be addressed through restrictive terms similar to those imposed by Justice Butler. [30] I would allow the application on terms.

Johnson Counsel for the Respondent: M.G. Scott Place and Date of Hearing: Vancouver, British Columbia January 24, 2020 Place and Date of Judgment: Vancouver, British Columbia January 24, 2020 Summary: Held: Appeal allowed. A restitution order requiring the appellant to pay in excess of $200,000 to redress damage cased to a tractor‑trailer and cargo in the course of a drug‑fueled crime spree is set aside. The order was made without enquiry into his ability to pay the amount, and appears to be based on the remote possibility of a windfall. R. v. Dunn, 2010 BCCA 22 applied. A restitution order in the amount of $6,500 in favour of the owner of the unit is issued in place of the one set aside. [1] SAUNDERS J.A. : David Lee Chappell seeks leave to appeal sentence and if leave be granted, appeals from a restitution order in the amount of $201,613.37 made on March 15, 2019, as part of the sentence for a number of offences that took place over six months. The spree culminated in an incident on November 6, 2017, when, attempting to evade arrest, he seized a tractor‑trailer, kidnapped the driver at the point of an imitation firearm, and when the driver escaped, attempted to drive the vehicle himself, rolling it down an embankment on the side of a highway. Mr. Chappell had been using crystal methamphetamine at the time of this offence and the sentencing judge described all of the offences as “drug fuelled”. Mr. Chappell pleaded guilty. [2] At the sentencing hearing, some information was provided to the judge as to Mr. Chappell’s past earning history, which was significant, in the oil and gas industry in Alberta. He had left that industry by the time of the offences. Most of the sentencing hearing concerned the length of the custodial sentence that should be imposed. The Crown sought a global sentence of seven years and seven months for all of his offences. Mr. Chappell sought a sentence of two years less a day after taking into account time served. [3] Also at the sentencing hearing, the Crown sought restitution orders in favour of his former intimate partner whose windshield he had broken, and the insurer of the tractor‑trailer, in the amounts of $449.01 and $201,613.37 respectively. In asking for them the Crown explained that they would be stand‑alone and not form part of the sentences, but “would be out there in the event that Mr. Chappell ever wins the lottery”. I understand that by saying they would not form part of the sentence Crown counsel was saying in a colloquial way that the restitution orders would not have penal consequences. The restitution orders, of course, are part of the sentence imposed and give rise to a sentence appeal: R. v. Nanos , 2013 BCCA 339. [4] There was some discussion between counsel for Mr. Chappell and the judge concerning the restitution order in relation to the windshield ($449.01) but through some mistake, no discussion at all with counsel about the restitution order in favour of the insurer. Apart from the assumption, implicit in the Crown’s suggestion that the restitution orders were there in the event Mr. Chappell had a windfall so that it was unlikely Mr. Chappell could satisfy the restitution orders, there was no discussion of the ability of Mr. Chappell to satisfy the orders. [5] The judge imposed a global sentence of five years and six months for the offences, reflecting a reduction in consideration of the totality principle. She then made both restitution orders sought by the Crown pursuant to s. 738 of the Criminal Code , R.S.C. 1985, c. C‑46, and did so without referring to Mr. Chappell’s capacity to pay. [6] Mr. Chappell does not contest the order he pay restitution to his former partner in the amount of $449.01. He appeals only the restitution order aimed at the damage he caused to the tractor‑trailer, equipment and cargo. He contends that the court erred in failing to consider his ability to pay the restitution order, both present and future, in accordance with the decision in R. v. Yates , 2002 BCCA 583 para. 17. He acknowledges, as he must, that his counsel did not protest the order at the sentencing hearing, but says that the Crown failed to lay the groundwork for the order by establishing in some fashion that payment was more than a pipe‑dream. Mr. Chappell refers us to R. v. Heathcliff , 2015 YKCA 15 at paras. 7–13, wherein the Yukon Court of Appeal reduced the amount of a restitution order when the sentencing judge ignored the offender’s ability to pay. [7] We can approach the question before us by asking whether the judge made an error in principle, or whether the sentence is demonstrably unfit. I prefer to address the appeal on the latter question, as it is clear to me that the restitution order imposed is excessive in the context of the information before the judge, so as to render it unfit in the circumstances. I conclude that on the record before us, it is most unlikely that Mr. Chappell will be able to make any meaningful dent in the amount owed, [8] In R. v. Dunn , 2010 BCCA 22, the judge had referred to the capacity of the offender to pay the restitution order by saying as to the likelihood of recovering the money: “Well, if he wins the lottery, I guess so.” Mr. Justice Donald observed that there had been no real inquiry into the capacity to pay the order and, in setting it aside, said: [12] I am unable to say that any useful purpose would be served by a restitution order where the likelihood of compliance is as remote as the judge said. The order was an afterthought made without the benefit of full argument and is unlikely to provide any tangible benefit to the victim. [9] There is no evidence, or even information, before us of prejudice from reliance on the restitution order. On the other hand, we do know that by s. 178(1) of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act , R.S.C. 1983, c. B‑3, a discharge from bankruptcy would not discharge Mr. Chappell from the restitution order. In other words, this order is likely to burden him indefinitely, and will make more difficult his rehabilitation as a fully participating member of the community, upon release from custody. [10] I consider that the restitution order in its current amount should be set aside. The question then is whether any order directed to the damage he did to the truck and cargo should be substituted. [11] Mr. Chappell proposes as an alternative to the order appealed, an order in the amount of $6,500 in favour of the owner of the vehicle, being the amount it paid as the deductible. That is not an insignificant sum, but is an amount that Mr. Chappell should be able to satisfy within some reasonable time after release from custody, given his employment history in the past.

Burgoyne, 2021 BCCA 51 Date: 20210120 Docket: CA46884 Between: Regina Respondent And Henry Harold Burgoyne Appellant Before: The Honourable Mr. Justice Abrioux The Honourable Mr. Justice Grauer The Honourable Mr. Justice Voith On appeal from: An order of the Provincial Court of British Columbia, dated May 21, 2020 ( R. v. Burgoyne , Cranbrook Dockets 33877‑1; 34378‑2‑C). Oral Reasons for Judgment Counsel for the Appellant (via videoconference): B. Blakley M.A.S. Blakley Counsel for the Respondent (via videoconference): C. Lusk Place and Date of Hearing: Vancouver, British Columbia January 20, 2021 Place and Date of Judgment: Vancouver, British Columbia January 20, 2021 Summary: The appellant pleaded guilty to assault and breaking and entering a dwelling house and committing an indictable offence therein. He appeals a “No Go” condition of his probation order restraining him from being within 100 kilometres of any place one of the victims lives, works, attends school, worships, or happens to be. Held: Leave to appeal granted; appeal allowed in part. The Crown concedes that the condition as worded amounts to a banishment condition and is unreasonable. The circumstances identified by the sentencing judge justify the imposition of a reasonable “No Go” condition. The condition is varied by replacing the words “100 kilometres” with “100 metres”. [1] VOITH J.A. : The appellant, Mr. Burgoyne, applies for leave to appeal from sentence and, if leave is granted, appeals a condition of the probation order that was imposed when he was sentenced. He entered guilty pleas to breaking and entering a dwelling house in Invermere, British Columbia, and committing assault therein, and to assaulting Ms. Arlene Hunter, the sister of his wife, Ms. Betty Burgoyne. He was sentenced for these two offences to 700 days’ jail and 90 days’ jail, respectively, to be served concurrently, less 315 days’ credit for 210 days actual time served, to be followed by three years’ probation. [2] On this appeal Mr. Burgoyne takes issue with a single term of the probation order. That condition requires Mr. Burgoyne to “not go to or be within 100 kilometres of any place where Betty Burgoyne lives, works, attends school, worships, or happens to be” and, in the event he sees her, to “leave her presence immediately without any words or gestures.” [3] The Crown concedes that the impugned condition, as worded, is unreasonable given the length and extent of the geographic restriction but submits that this Court ought to vary, rather than remove, the condition “by substituting metres for kilometres.” [4] The circumstances of Mr. Burgoyne’s offences were captured in an Agreed Statement of Facts. On October 24, 2019, Mr. Burgoyne entered the residence of Ms. Hunter (defined as the “Residence” in the Agreed Statement of Facts). The Residence is located in Invermere, British Columbia. [5] Mr. Burgoyne was intoxicated when he entered the Residence. He then assaulted Ms. Hunter in the Residence by kneeing her in the stomach. He wanted his wife, Ms. Burgoyne, to go home with him, but she refused, saying that he was drunk. Mr. Burgoyne was told to leave the Residence, which he did after some delay. Mr. Burgoyne left the Residence driving a green pickup truck. He was prohibited from driving at the time under the Motor Vehicle Act , R.S.B.C. 1996, c. 318. [6] Mr. Burgoyne then returned and entered the Residence just after midnight. He was carrying a loaded .22 calibre rifle with the safety on. In the hallway, Mr. Michel, another person at the Residence, wrestled the rifle away from Mr. Burgoyne and pushed him out the door. [7] Mr. Burgoyne was arrested a short time later, while driving the green pickup truck. He later stated to the police that Mr. Michel should have let him walk past so that he could shoot Ms. Hunter. [8] Before the sentencing judge, the Crown sought a custodial sentence of six years. The defence sought a sentence of time served. The sentencing judge, in unreported reasons dated May 21, 2020, read the Agreed Statement of Facts into the record. He addressed Mr. Burgoyne’s circumstances, noting that he was 54 years old, that he was of Indigenous descent, that aspects of his life had been difficult, and that a “thorough” Gladue report had been prepared for the sentencing. [9] He addressed Mr. Burgoyne’s criminal record, which consisted of seven convictions over 37 years. Four of those convictions related to driving while impaired. He had two prior convictions for assault and one for assault causing bodily harm, though each of these latter convictions was dated. [10] The sentencing judge addressed the three victim impact statements that had been filed and dealt with two of them, from Ms. Hunter and Ms. Burgoyne, at some length. [11] The sentencing judge noted that Mr. Burgoyne recognized that “alcohol and anger were factors” in the offences and that he was an alcoholic. The sentencing judge further noted that, unfortunately, Mr. Burgoyne did not see the need to receive any treatment and that he blamed Ms. Hunter for the offences. The sentencing judge then dealt with the mitigating and aggravating circumstances before the court, several of which are relevant to this appeal. [12] The sentencing judge accepted that Mr. Burgoyne “believe[d]” that he had made a stupid mistake and that this would not happen again. It seems clear, however, that the sentencing judge was skeptical about this assurance. He again noted that, unfortunately, Mr. Burgoyne saw “no need to address his alcoholism” and that it appeared he had “no empathy for the harm he has caused to Arlene Hunter and the other victims.” He said, “It is clear Mr. Burgoyne was not traumatized by what happened and that concerns me.” [13] He emphasized that the offences had occurred at a dwelling house, that Mr. Burgoyne knew the house was occupied, and that there had been some violence, which are deemed to be aggravating circumstances under s. 348.1 of the Criminal Code , R.S.C. 1985, c. C‑46. It was also an aggravating factor that there was a firearm involved. He considered that it was a further aggravating factor that the break and enter had occurred twice. He observed that on the first occasion, when he was confronted, Mr. Burgoyne left the Residence. He also said, “Sadly or unfortunately this did not cool off his anger, and he in fact upped the ante and he made everything more terrifying for everyone in that residence.” [14] Still further, the sentencing judge noted that the offences were in the nature of a domestic dispute, and he quoted from portions of s. 718.2(a) of the Criminal Code , which provide that the following are deemed to be aggravating circumstances: (ii) evidence that the offender, in committing the offence, abused the offender’s intimate partner or a member of the victim or the offender’s family … (iii.1) evidence that the offence had a significant impact on the victim, considering their age and other personal circumstances, including their health and financial situation … [15] The trial judge also noted relevant mitigating factors, including the fact that Mr. Burgoyne had pleaded guilty, that he had generally been a productive member of society, and that he did not have a general pattern of antisocial behaviour. He recognized that Mr. Burgoyne was of Indigenous descent and the resulting importance of s. 718.2(e) of the Criminal Code . He noted that the Gladue report he had reviewed had been helpful and informative and that “without it the sentence would almost certainly have been higher.” [16] Finally, it is relevant that in imposing various conditions of probation, the judge did not impose any rehabilitative conditions. This is notwithstanding the role that alcohol played in these offences and Mr. Burgoyne’s history of difficulty with alcohol. This was, again, on account of the fact that Mr. Burgoyne was not willing to attend counselling, a fact that was confirmed in the Gladue report that was before the court. Instead, various protective conditions were imposed with reference to the conditions as worded and numbered in the General Harmonized 2019 Probation and Peace Bond Picklist (December 16, 2019) (the “Picklist”). [17] Under condition 2002, the judge imposed a “No Contact” condition, prohibiting Mr. Burgoyne from directly or indirectly contacting or communicating with Ms. Hunter, Ms. Burgoyne, or a Mr. Jesse Paul. [18] The judge did not purport to rely on condition 2302‑2, the “Banishment” condition. Instead, under condition 2005‑1, which is described as a “No Go” condition, he imposed a condition that Mr. Burgoyne not go or be “within 100 kilometres of any place where [Ms.] Burgoyne lives, works, attends school, worships, or happens to be.” However, condition 2005‑1, as it appears on the Picklist, starts with the words “you must not go to (or be within ____ metres of)” where one or more named individuals “lives, works, attends school, worships, or happens to be.” When the sentencing judge pronounced this condition, the defence inquired, and the judge confirmed, that he had intended to impose a 100‑kilometre restriction. [19] Sentencing judges have considerable latitude in crafting appropriate conditions of probation: R. v. Shoker , 2006 SCC 44 at para. 14; R. v. Goddard , 2019 BCCA 164 at para. 19. The sentencing judge’s decision about which conditions to include in a probation order involves an exercise of discretion. An appellate court will intervene in that exercise of discretion only if the judge has erred in principle, imposed a condition that is clearly unreasonable, or if the order is manifestly inappropriate or renders the sentence unfit: Goddard at para. 19; R. v. Manca , 2019 BCCA 280 at para. 42. [20] Under the residual clause in s. 732.1(3)(h) of the Criminal Code , a judge has broad authority to impose reasonable conditions that are considered desirable to protect the public and to facilitate an offender’s reintegration into the community: Manca at para. 39. [21] Conditions of probation do not have to be linked to the offence. There must, however, be a nexus between the offender, the protection of the public, and the offender’s reintegration or rehabilitation into the community: R. v. Duguay , 2019 BCCA 53 at para. 65, citing Shoker at para. 13. Furthermore, conditions may serve either one or both of the purposes of protection of the public and rehabilitation: R. v. Timmins , 2006 BCCA 354 at para. 9; Goddard at para. 23; Duguay at para. 63. Finally, conditions must be clear, unambiguous, enforceable, and compliant with federal and provincial laws and the Charter : Goddard at paras. 20–23. [22] Mr. Burgoyne reasonably characterizes the condition at issue, which adopts the language of a “No Go” condition from the Picklist, as amounting to a banishment condition due to its geographic scope. The Crown agrees with this characterization. Banishment conditions are rare: R. v. Forner , 2020 BCCA 103 at para. 53. They are often viewed as “fundamentally wrong”: Forner at para. 53. In R. v. Rowe (2006), 212 C.C.C. (3d) 254 at para. 7, the Ontario Court of Appeal said, “Plainly, the larger the ambit of the banishment, the more difficult the order will be to justify.” [23] Counsel accept that, if the sentencing judge has made an error in principle, this Court can undertake its own analysis to determine a fit sentence or condition of probation: R. v. Friesen , 2020 SCC 9 at para. 27; Manca at paras. 42, 53, 56. [24] Mr. Burgoyne raises various concerns in relation to the condition that the judge imposed. I have said that the Crown agrees that the condition was inappropriate in the circumstances of this case. There is, accordingly, no need to address aspects of the specific concerns that are raised and developed by Mr. Burgoyne. [25] The only question is whether the No Contact condition that was imposed by the sentencing judge is sufficient, without more, in the circumstances of this case. Alternatively, is a new “No Go” restriction, which limits Mr. Burgoyne’s ability to go within some reasonable physical distance of where Ms. Burgoyne lives, works, attends school, worships, or happens to be, reasonable in the circumstances of this case? [26] Not surprisingly, such determinations are largely case specific. In R. v. Deering , 2019 NLCA 31, the accused appealed a condition of his probation order that barred him from being present on any part of the Burin Peninsula in Newfoundland south of a particular bridge. He had an “unenviable criminal record” of 82 convictions over 17 years. Of those convictions, 36 involved breaches of probation: at para. 6. The court observed that “the appellant’s criminal history demonstrates an unwillingness or inability to abide by court orders in general and no‑contact orders in particular”: at para. 22. The court upheld the challenged condition of probation. [27] In Forner , the appellant appealed both her custodial sentence and a condition in her probation order that prevented her from being within a 50‑kilometre radius of Osoyoos, British Columbia, other than with the written permission of her probation officer. The Court noted that at the time of the offence, the appellant had a 16‑year history of alcohol abuse. She expressed what was considered to be genuine and significant remorse about the offence but said she had no memory of it: at para. 12. The Court subsequently emphasized the appellant’s genuine remorse, her post‑offence rehabilitation efforts, and her lack of any record of violent behaviour: at para. 50. When addressing the banishment condition, the Court noted the condition would force the appellant to live outside of her community of ordinary residence, thereby likely hindering her rehabilitation: at para. 59. There was also no reason to believe that the condition would render society safer or more secure: at para. 60. [28] Notably, in Forner , the Court considered that there were other conditions in place that would protect the victim of the appellant’s attack. This included both a prohibition on the appellant having any direct or indirect contact or communication with the victim or her family and a further prohibition that prevented her from going to any residence, school, or workplace of the victim or members of her immediate family: at para. 60. Accordingly, the Court considered that “the safety of the victim and her children has been addressed”: at para. 60. [29] In this case, Mr. Burgoyne’s primary submission is that there is no basis for a “No Go” condition because there is no evidence that he poses a risk or danger to his wife. In aid of this submission his counsel identifies, for example, that it was Ms. Hunter, rather than Ms. Burgoyne, who was assaulted. [30] This mischaracterizes what occurred. Mr. Burgoyne broke into the Residence to get his wife to leave with him, in circumstances where she made clear that she did not wish to do so. Ms. Hunter was assaulted because she appears to have been in the way. He later returned to the Residence with a loaded weapon. Furthermore, the assertion that he did not assault Ms. Burgoyne, or poses no risk to her, ignores the significant distress and ongoing anxiety that he has caused her. She too was a victim of his actions. [31] Mr. Burgoyne also argued, in the alternative, that some of the language of the “No Go” condition the sentencing judge imposed should be varied to address various potential scenarios and changes of circumstance. Under s. 732.2(3) of the Criminal Code , it is open to Mr. Burgoyne, should there be such a change of circumstance, to return before the sentencing judge and to seek a variation of the conditions of his probation. [32] In the present circumstances, the various conditions of probation that the sentencing judge imposed were protective, rather than rehabilitative, in nature. Mr. Burgoyne showed no remorse for his offences. His offences took place in an occupied dwelling house and were violent in nature. He showed no interest in addressing his difficulties with alcohol, though he recognized that they had likely fueled his behaviour. He also had some history of violence, albeit dated. The victim impact statements the judge referred to established that Mr. Burgoyne’s behaviour had caused Ms. Burgoyne considerable anxiety and concern for her safety. [33] There is a clear nexus between a reasonable “No Go” condition and Mr. Burgoyne’s offences. Such “No Go” conditions, though restrictive, are frequently justified in the case of violent and other offences. There is often no good reason for an offender who has committed a violent offence to be within a limited but fixed distance of the victim or the places she frequents. [34] Further, as previously noted, Mr. Burgoyne drove his pickup truck while prohibited from driving under the Motor Vehicle Act . He was sentenced simultaneously on a separate information for a guilty plea to operating a motor vehicle while prohibited. The sentencing judge referred to a statement attributed to Mr. Burgoyne in his Gladue report that he has never had a driver’s licence, and the judge noted that Mr. Burgoyne appeared to have “no intention of complying with the law”. This demonstrates some unwillingness on Mr. Burgoyne’s part to abide by legal prohibitions. [35] Accordingly, I would grant leave to appeal from sentence and allow the appeal to the extent of varying the “No Go” condition that was imposed by the sentencing judge by replacing the words “100 kilometres” with “100 metres”. [36] ABRIOUX J.A. : I agree. [37] GRAUER J.A. : I agree. [38] ABRIOUX J.A. : Leave to appeal from sentence is granted and the appeal is allowed to the extent of varying the “No Go” condition that was imposed by the sentencing judge by replacing the words “100 kilometres” with “100 metres”. “The Honourable Mr. Justice Voith”"},"meta":{},"created_at":"2022-03-03T02:25:43.696603Z","updated_at":"2022-03-04T04:59:33.665877Z","project":1},{"id":14,"annotations":[{"id":20,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"start":0,"end":36,"text":"COURT OF APPEAL FOR BRITISH COLUMBIA","labels":["COURT_NAME"]},"id":"ogZKgBF-H9","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":47,"end":114,"text":"Polygon Metalworks Int’l Inc. v.

Ellisdon Corporation, 2019 BCCA 20 Date: 20190110 Docket: CA45610 Between: Polygon Metalworks Int’l. Inc. Appellant (Plaintiff) And Ellisdon Corporation Respondent (Defendant) Before: The Honourable Madam Justice Saunders (In Chambers) On appeal from: An order of the Supreme Court of British Columbia, dated August 28, 2018 ( Polygon Metalworks Int’l Inc. v. Ellisdon Corporation , 2018 BCSC 1448, Vancouver Docket S167197). Oral Reasons for Judgment The Appellant, appearing in person: H. Popa Counsel for the Respondent: K. Johanson S. Small, Articled Student Place and Date of Hearing: Vancouver, British Columbia January 10, 2019 Place and Date of Judgment: Vancouver, British Columbia January 10, 2019 Summary: The appellant was one day late in presenting the appeal record for filing. It missed the deadline due to technical problems in producing the binders. Held: the appellant’s application to extend the time for filing (opposed by the respondent), is granted. The respondent applied for an order security for costs of the appeal be posted. Held: application granted. Security set at $7,000. [1] SAUNDERS J.A. : There are two applications before me today, the appellant’s application to extend the time for filing the appeal record and the respondent’s application for an order the appellant post security for costs within 30 days and that the appeal be stayed pending the security being posted. The respondent proposes the amount to be posted as security for costs be $9,215. [2] Logically the application for an extension of time should be decided first because absent the extension the appeal cannot proceed. [3] The appeal is from a judgment in favour of the appellant in the amount of $2,033.55. The litigation arises from a dispute on a construction project in downtown Vancouver wherein the respondent subcontracted with the appellant to provide and install stainless steel for the project. The original letter of intent contemplated that the appellant would commence onsite work in September 2014. The parties further agreed that the appellant’s work would be completed by November 2015. [4] As it turned out, the appellant could not start working on the project until January 2015. It began installing stainless steel on site in or around March 2015. On November 3, 2015, the respondent purported to terminate the subcontract, citing the existence of outstanding work and claiming that the appellant had contravened the agreed-upon schedule. [5] The appellant commenced an action for an amount far in excess of the judgment it obtained. [6] The appellant filed a notice of appeal on September 26, 2018. The time for filing the appeal record and transcripts expired on November 26, 2018. Mr. Popa has appeared today as the principal of Polygon. He deposes he would have filed the appeal record on November 26, but could not because of problems with printing it and he did not have the pages available that day to have it compiled into the bound document in time to file it in the court registry. That all was done by November 27 but, he deposes, when he presented the appeal record to the registry November 27, the registry refused to allow it to be filed on the basis he was out of time. [7] The respondent, Don Ellis, opposes the extension of time saying that it is not evident on the material filed the appellant has continuously intended to appeal and that the appeal lacks merit. The respondent also says it is not in the interests of justice that the appeal continue. [8] The test for an extension of time is well-known and is set out in Davies v. C.I.B.C. (1987), 15 B.C.L.R. (2d) 256 (C.A.): 1. Was there a bona fide intention to appeal? 2. When were the respondents informed of the intention? 3. Would the respondents be unduly prejudiced by an extension of time? 4. Is there merit in the appeal? 5. Is it in the interests of justice that an extension be granted? The overarching consideration is always the fifth point – is it in the interests of justice that an extension be granted? [9] The respondent’s submission relating to the appellant’s intention to appeal relies upon a lack of evidence that transcripts have been ordered, the fact that the filing of the transcripts is also out of time, and the absence of any reference to this in today’s application – the transcripts having been required to be filed at the same time as the appeal record. Mr. Popa says that the transcripts have been ordered, but the order for transcripts is not reflected in any affidavit. [10] On balance I am satisfied the appellant has had a bona fide intention to appeal throughout that intention is demonstrated by the filing of the notice of appeal in a timely way and the appellant’s attempt to file the appeal record, albeit a day late, on November 27. [11] The larger consideration is the merits of the case. Because the appeal is at such an early stage, it is difficult to discern the merits of the appeal. I understand that the appellant contends both that findings of fact are contrary to the documentary evidence and that the judge constricted his ability to cross-examine. Doing the best I can and on the basis of what I know, it seems that there is sufficient merit to warrant the extension of time. I will say that as an appeal progresses more may be known that persuades a judge the appeal is doomed to fail, but in this case I cannot say that now. It does seem to me, however, that the appeal is not strong. [12] I consider in the circumstances that an extension of time to file the appeal record is in the interests of justice. I would extend the time for filing the appeal record to today, January 10, 2019. [13] I note that Mr. Popa still has to receive the transcripts of the trial and that he will require an extension of time in order to file them, absent consent. No doubt the evidence of when the transcripts were ordered will be germane to such an application, and that will all be for a later date. [14] I turn to the application for security for costs. The test for security for costs is set out by Mr. Justice Lowry in Creative Salmon Company Ltd. v. Staniford , 2007 BCCA 285 as follows: [9] The jurisdiction to order security for costs of an appeal is found in s. 24 of the Court of Appeal Act , R.S.B.C. 1996, c. 77. The appellant against which such an order is sought bears the onus of showing why security should not be required: Kedia v. Shandro Dixon Edgson , 2007 BCCA 57 at para. 4 (C.A. Chambers), Smith J.A. Generally, the considerations are the appellant's ability to post security and the likelihood of costs awarded being recovered from it, as well as the merits and the timeliness of the application: Southeast Toyota Distributors, Inc. v. Branch (1997), 45 B.C.L.R. (3d) 163 (C.A.); Milina v. Bartsch (1985), 5 C.P.C. (2d) 124 at 125 (B.C.C.A. Chambers), Seaton J.A.; and M.(M.) v. F.(R.) (1997), 43 B.C.L.R. (3d) 98 at 101 (C.A. Chambers), Esson J.A. The overarching concern is whether the order sought is in the interests of justice. [15] Here the respondent has demonstrated it could not locate exigible assets. The merits of the appeal are not strong. Mr. Popa says in an affidavit he has no assets but he does not say that the appellant has no assets; if he did say that, the statement would demonstrate that the costs will not be readily recoverable. Mr. Popa says that the appellant, which has been struck from the company register, is in the process of being reinstated, but there are, we know, judgments already registered against the company. [16] On balance, I consider that an order for security for costs should be made. I would set the amount of security at $7,000 to be posted within 30 days. This order is accompanied by a stay of the appeal until the security for costs is posted, except for the filing of the appeal record that I have allowed and must be completed today. [17] All of this means, Mr. Popa, that to file the transcripts needed to advance this appeal, you first must post the security for costs and you will need an order allowing you to file the transcripts in any event. [18] I have considered the respondent’s further request for leave to apply to augment the amount of the security for costs in the event unexpected applications or other court proceedings are required to push this appeal to conclusion. I have decided not to make such an order. The respondent, in that event, will have to simply rely upon our Rules for relief. “The Honourable Madam Justice Saunders”"},"meta":{},"created_at":"2022-03-03T02:25:43.696479Z","updated_at":"2022-03-04T04:32:42.166205Z","project":1},{"id":13,"annotations":[{"id":19,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"start":0,"end":36,"text":"COURT OF APPEAL FOR BRITISH COLUMBIA","labels":["COURT_NAME"]},"id":"8VMzO9RWwc","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":47,"end":83,"text":"Pavlovich v.

Danilovic, 2020 BCCA 36 Date: 20200117 Docket: CA45939 Between: Ljuba Pavlovich Respondent (Plaintiff) And Alexander Gordon Danilovic Appellant (Defendant) Before: The Honourable Madam Justice DeWitt‑Van Oosten (In Chambers) On appeal from: An order of the Supreme Court of British Columbia, dated February 11, 2019 ( Pavlovich v. Danilovic , 2019 BCSC 153, Vancouver Docket S158302). Oral Reasons for Judgment Counsel for the Appellant: J.M. Richter A.M. James Counsel for the Respondent: R.D. Bellamy Place and Date of Hearing: Vancouver, British Columbia January 17, 2020 Place and Date of Judgment: Vancouver, British Columbia January 17, 2020 Summary: The appellant applied to file an amended factum and supplementary appeal book, as well as to adjourn the hearing of the appeal. Held: Application allowed. The additional issue raised by the appellant stems from recent developments in the case law, was raised in the court below, and likely can be addressed on the already‑established factual record. An adjournment of the appeal carries little prejudice. [1] DEWITT‑VAN OOSTEN J.A. : The appellant, Alexander Danilovic, seeks three orders: (1) leave to file an amended factum; (2) leave to file a supplementary appeal book that includes the closing submissions at trial; and (3) an adjournment of the hearing of the appeal (scheduled for January 22, 2020). [2] The appellant has also filed an application to adduce fresh evidence at the appeal; however, that application is not before me. Instead, it will be determined by the division that hears the appeal on its merits. [3] The appeal arises out of a dispute between the parties about their respective entitlement to beneficial interest in two residential properties purchased by the parties’ parents, both of whom are now deceased. [4] After the mother’s death, and at separate times, each of the properties was made the subject of a joint tenancy between the father and the appellant, Mr. Danilovic. I understand that the second of these transfers was executed solely by the appellant, relying on a power of attorney provided to him by his father that allowed the appellant to transfer the father’s assets to himself. The father passed away and died intestate (a will has not been located). If the joint tenancies effected a transfer of the entire legal and beneficial interest in the properties to the appellant, including rights of survivorship, the properties would not form part of the father’s estate for division amongst any deemed beneficiaries. [5] It is Mr. Danilovic’s position that he is entitled to full legal and beneficial ownership of the properties and that his father intended such to be the case at the time the transfers were made. Ljuba Pavlovich, the appellant’s sister and respondent in this matter, contends that the appellant holds the properties in trust and she is entitled to a share of their value equal to that of any other deemed beneficiaries, including (but not limited to) the appellant. [6] The dispute between the siblings went to trial: Pavlovich v. Danilovic, 2019 BCSC 153 [“Trial Reasons”]. The trial judge rejected the respondent’s submission in favour of an express trust. However, she found that the transfers into a joint tenancy with the appellant were “gratuitous” and, as such, subject to a rebuttable presumption of resulting trust. The judge further found that the appellant did not displace that presumption on the evidence. The judge could not determine the father’s intention on a balance of probabilities. Instead, the “evidence [stood] in equipoise” (at para. 55). In light of this conclusion, and by operation of the presumption, the judge declared that the appellant holds both properties on a resulting trust for the father’s estate (at para. 56). [7] The appellant seeks to overturn the judge’s ruling. In his factum, filed May 31, 2019, he raises one ground of appeal, namely, that the judge committed palpable and overriding error in concluding the appellant failed to rebut the presumption of a resulting trust. [8] The ground of appeal has three components. Specifically, the appellant contends that the judge: (1) failed to consider testimony provided by the appellant’s spouse on the father’s intention in transferring the properties; (2) failed to consider documentary evidence consistent with the appellant’s position; and (3) speculated about the transfer of the properties reflecting an intentional financial strategy that was “aimed at saving the family money in probate”. [9] The appellant’s notice of motion, brought on December 20, 2019, seeks to file an amended factum that adds an additional argument in support of his appeal. [10] In particular, he asks for leave to advance the proposition that the trial judge erred in law by limiting her analysis on the father’s intention at the time of the impugned transfers to whether the father intended that the appellant receive beneficial ownership of the properties. The appellant says the judge should have also considered, as a separate possibility, that the father intended to transfer an immediate legal interest, retain beneficial ownership during his lifetime, but give the appellant a right of survivorship that would entitle him to full and exclusive beneficial ownership of both properties upon the father’s death. The appellant says the trial judge failed to appreciate that a right of survivorship is a distinct right accompanying a joint tenancy. [11] The additional ground of appeal has been brought forward seven months after the appellant filed his factum. The hearing of the appeal is less than a week away (as noted, it is scheduled for January 22). The appellant appreciates that the request to amend is late in the day; however, he says it is based on two decisions that were released after he filed his factum, one of which is this Court’s decision in Herbach v. Herbach Estate, 2019 BCCA 370 (released October 11, 2019). The appellant says the case clarifies, at para. 24, that a transfer of property into joint tenancy may consist of an immediate grant of a legal interest and a beneficial right of survivorship, even though the transferor retains beneficial ownership of the property during their lifetime. With this kind of an arrangement, full beneficial ownership of the property vests in the joint tenant upon death. [12] The appellant says that Herbach and a decision out of the British Columbia Supreme Court ( Petrick v. Petrick, 2019 BCSC 1319) raise a critical point that should have been considered by the trial judge on the evidentiary foundation before her. She did not do so and the appellant contends that as a result, the judge applied an incomplete legal test in deciding whether the evidence relied upon by the appellant was sufficient to rebut the presumption of a resulting trust. She could have found that the presumption had been rebutted, even though not satisfied of proof of an intention to transfer beneficial ownership of the properties to the appellant at the time the relevant documents were executed. [13] In fact, the appellant intends to argue that this is the only logical conclusion the trial judge could have reached. She accepted that the father “organized his affairs including his property holdings so as to minimize his tax obligations” on death: Trial Reasons at para. 47. She also found that his actions in doing so were informed by an understanding of the legal consequences of a joint tenancy, based on his assumption of full legal and beneficial ownership of the impugned properties when his wife died many years prior (at para. 47). This would have included a right of survivorship. In light of the judge’s findings, the appellant says that her conclusion about the evidence not rebutting a presumption of resulting trust cannot stand. Had she turned her mind to the right of survivorship as a distinct right, capable of transfer at the time the joint tenancy was created, she would have had to have found that the father’s intention must have been to transfer a right of survivorship in both properties to the appellant, consistent with the results of his own joint tenancy with his spouse. He would have understood that that was the route by which to keep the properties out of his estate and free from the related tax implications. [14] The respondent is opposed to the request to file an amended factum. Among other things, she cites MacMillan Bloedel v. Youell (1993) , 23 B.C.A.C. 214, 43 A.C.W.S. (3d) 7 (B.C.C.A.) and Block Bros. Realty Ltd. v. Boese and Gonzo (1988) , 24 B.C.L.R. (2d) 178 (C.A.), which stand for the proposition that a party should not be allowed to amend their factum shortly before the hearing unless it is beyond doubt that all factual issues relevant to the new issue were before the trial court (see para. 12 of MacMillan and para. 3 of Block Bros. ). The respondent argues that in this case, it cannot be said that all factual issues relevant to the proposed amendments were before the court. To the contrary, the respondent says the issue now sought to be raised is closely entwined with the fresh evidence that the appellant seeks to introduce at the hearing of the appeal, making the point that the appellant cannot substantiate the additional alleged error in the absence of a buttressed evidentiary record. [15] After hearing submissions from both sides, and reviewing the application materials, I am satisfied it is in the interests of justice to grant the appellant leave to amend his factum as requested; grant leave to file a supplementary appeal book with the closing submissions from trial; and adjourn the appeal to ensure that the respondent has sufficient opportunity to respond to the amended factum. In light of this ruling, if the respondent considers it necessary to amend her factum to respond to the new ground of appeal, she has leave to do so. [16] In my view, the additional argument likely can be resolved on the factual record established in the court below, although, ultimately, that will be for the division to determine. The issue is not dependent on the admission of the fresh evidence. This is not a situation akin to Shannon v. Gidden, 1999 BCCA 461 (Chambers), for example, in which leave to file an amended factum was denied because an entirely different body of evidence was required to properly assess the newly found challenge to the judge’s ruling (at para. 6). A central issue at trial in this case was the father’s intention at the time of the impugned transfers. Considerable evidence was called on that point, including the history involving the two properties, the father’s involvement with the properties, and the effect of his spouse’s death on his beneficial ownership of those properties. [17] The judge made specific findings in that regard. The additional legal argument in support of overturning the trial judgment can likely be assessed with reference to those findings, within the context of the reasons as a whole. I agree with the appellant that on the face of it, the supplemental issue is more legal in nature than it is factual and, consistent with the approach taken in MacMillan at para. 13, I am reluctant to deny the appellant an opportunity to advance an issue of that nature. In response to his sister’s notice of civil claim, the appellant pleaded that the father intended to “gift an undivided one half interest” in both properties to the appellant. This pleading is broad enough in scope to include the argument now raised by the appellant. I am also satisfied, based on the closing submissions, that the right of survivorship was addressed by both parties before the trial judge. It was a live issue at trial. [18] The orders sought by the appellant are discretionary. The appeal was filed in March 2019, less than a year ago. The January 22 date is the first hearing date for the appeal and I understand that if adjourned, there is time available for hearing in February and March. In fact, I have been advised that the parties have spoken of a new date and counsel agree the appeal could be heard on March 24. As such, an adjournment will not result in considerable delay. The appellant has provided a legitimate reason for the proposed amendments to his factum and request for an adjournment. I accept that clarity on the proper analytical approach for the assessment of a right of survivorship did not present itself to the appellant until October 2019, when Herbach was released. The proposed amendments to the factum have been articulated and the respondent has been aware of them since December. I do not consider the additional issue to be overly complex. In my view, the prejudice brought about by an amendment, the addition of the closing submissions (already known to the respondent), and a relatively brief adjournment of the appeal, is minimal. [19] The appeal is hereby removed from the hearing list for January 22, 2020, and adjourned generally. Counsel are to confirm March 24, 2020, as the new date as expeditiously as possible. [20] Costs on the application will be costs in the appeal. “The Honourable Madam Justice DeWitt‑Van Oosten”"},"meta":{},"created_at":"2022-03-03T02:25:43.696413Z","updated_at":"2022-03-04T04:19:59.150021Z","project":1},{"id":12,"annotations":[{"id":18,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"start":3,"end":40,"text":"THE SUPREME COURT OF BRITISH COLUMBIA","labels":["COURT_NAME"]},"id":"-26JtdH7dj","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":51,"end":82,"text":"Onstein v.

Onstein, 2020 BCSC 2 Date: 20200102 Docket: E6620 Registry: Prince Rupert Between: Fiona Onstein Claimant And Robert Onstein Respondent Before: The Honourable Mr. Justice Funt Reasons for Judgment Counsel for the Claimant: W. MacGregor A. Lax Counsel for the Respondent: T. Summers Place and Dates of Hearing: Terrace, B.C. November 6, 7, and December 12, 2019 Place and Date of Judgment: Prince Rupert, B.C. January 2, 2020 [1] On March 12, 2008, the parties entered into a well-crafted separation agreement (the “SA”), which, among other matters, addresses child support. The parties each had counsel. [2] On August 29, 2017, the claimant filed the SA with the Court. The claimant now applies to enforce the SA: Family Law Act , S.B.C. 2011, c. 25 [ FLA ], s. 148(2); Supreme Court Family Rules , B.C. Reg. 169\/2009 [ SCFR ], R. 2-1 and R. 10-5(1). [3] On September 21, 2018, the claimant filed an application seeking a retroactive increase in child support from July 2009 to August 2017. As of July 1, 2009, the parties’ three children were 10, 11 and 13 years old. After August 2017, there was either no longer a duty to provide child support or child support was provided to the claimant’s satisfaction. [4] Over the relevant years, the parties lived within a block of each other in single family houses and co-operated in the raising of each of the children. [5] Each of the children is now well-positioned for the future. Each enjoyed an emotionally and financially supportive environment. [6] For the reasons that follow, the claimant’s application is dismissed. [7] Under the SA, the parties were to remain joint guardians, put the best interests of the children before their own interests, exchange information regularly about the children, and consult about important decisions including education and recreational activities: SA, sections 4 and 6. [8] Section 7 of the SA further provides (in part): 7. (1) Rob [the respondent] shall pay to Fiona [the claimant] for the support and maintenance of the Children the sum of $700.00 per month commencing the 1st day of January, 2008 and the 1st day each month thereafter. (2) Rob shall pay the following extraordinary expenses for the Children: (a) the tuition fees tor the Children to attend Veritas School in Terrace, BC; (b) the Children’s current extracurricular activities, being Scouting and dance and such other extracurricular activities as the parties may agree, provided however, that if the cost of such extracurricular activities increases, the parties shall revisit responsibility for payment of the same; (c) for so long as coverage for the Children through his employment, the medical and dental insurance premiums attributable to the Children and any uncovered amount for medical and dental expenses for the Children. … (5) The parties agree that the quantum of child support payable by Rob takes into account: (i) the amounts set out in the Federal Child Support Guidelines payable by each parent to the other, for the Children; (ii) the increased costs of the shared custody arrangement; and (iii) the condition, means, needs other circumstances of each spouse and of the Children; … (8) If a Child, after attaining the age of 19 years, continues to be a child of the marriage as a result of pursing full time education, (i) the parties will review and determine child support for that Child, by reference to the Child’s actual and reasonable needs and expenses, less the amount which, the Child can be expected to contribute to the Child ’s own support, and scholarships, bursaries or tax credits; (ii) if a Child lives away from home to attend a post-secondary educational institution the parties will review the amount of support payable in order to take into account reduced food, housing and other costs for the Child when he or she is away at university and the cost of tuition and residency. [9] Under section 8 of the SA, child support shall be reviewed annually. Section 8 reads: 8. (1) By July 1 st of each year, commencing in 2009, child support shall be reviewed. In order to accomplish such review, each of the parties shall provide (a) the documents required in section 21(1) of the Federal Child Support Guidelines ; (b) current information about the Children’s special or extraordinary expenses; (c) details of Child Tax Benefit or other Child Benefits received in the previous year and anticipated in the coming year. (2) Unless support is adjusted by an amending agreement in writing, or court order, Rob will continue to pay child support in accordance [with] the parties’ most recent written agreement or court order. [10] Under section 31 of the SA, dispute resolution is addressed. Section 31 reads: 31. (1) If a dispute arises concerning parenting of the Children or payment of child support under this Agreement, the parties will try and resolve the dispute through mediation. (2) If Rob or Fiona seeks a change in paragraph 4 with respect to parenting or paragraph 7 with respect to support, he or she will give the other notice in writing: (a) notice of the proposed change; (b) evidence supporting the proposed change; and (c) any requests for information from the other necessary to determine the issue. (3) A request under section (2) will be answered within fourteen (14) days. (4) After exchanging any information required by this agreement, Fiona and Rob will meet personally or through their personal representatives to resolve the issues in dispute. (5) If they come to an agreement, Rob and Fiona will enter into an amending agreement in writing signed before witnesses. (6) If the parties are unable to come to an agreement with respect to a dispute, the parties shall retain the services of a mediator and each party will be responsible for payment of one-half of the mediation costs. (7) If, notwithstanding their best efforts through use of a mediator, the parties are unable to come to an agreement with respect to a dispute either party may apply to a court or competent jurisdiction to resolve the matter. [11] Two further general sections of relevance to the case at bar read: 35. The parties may vary this Agreement only by written agreement executed in the same manner as this Agreement. 36. Rob and Fiona will each do everything reasonably necessary to give full effect to this Agreement. [12] Finally, under section 42 of the SA, the parties acknowledge: (a) each of them relies on this Agreement to be enforced according to its terms; and (b) neither of them would have entered into this Agreement or continued their relationship [on] the basis of it, had it been anticipated that the other would ever apply to vary the Agreement. [13] As noted, section 8 of the SA refers to documents requested under s. 21(1) of the Federal Child Support Guidelines , SOR\/97-175 [ FCSG ]. Section 21(1) of the FCSG reads: Obligation of applicant 21 (1) A spouse who is applying for a child support order and whose income information is necessary to determine the amount of the order must include the following with the application: (a) a copy of every personal income tax return filed by the spouse for each of the three most recent taxation years; (b) a copy of every notice of assessment and reassessment issued to the spouse for each of the three most recent taxation years; (c) where the spouse is an employee, the most recent statement of earnings indicating the total earnings paid in the year to date, including overtime or, where such a statement is not provided by the employer, a letter from the spouse’s employer setting out that information including the spouse’s rate of annual salary or remuneration; (d) where the spouse is self-employed, for the three most recent taxation years (i) the financial statements of the spouse’s business or professional practice, other than a partnership, and (ii) a statement showing a breakdown of all salaries, wages, management fees or other payments or benefits paid to, or on behalf of, persons or corporations with whom the spouse does not deal at arm’s length; (e) where the spouse is a partner in a partnership, confirmation of the spouse’s income and draw from, and capital in, the partnership for its three most recent taxation years; (f) where the spouse controls a corporation, for its three most recent taxation years (i) the financial statements of the corporation and its subsidiaries, and (ii) a statement showing a breakdown of all salaries, wages, management fees or other payments or benefits paid to, or on behalf of, persons or corporations with whom the corporation, and every related corporation, does not deal at arm’s length; (g) where the spouse is a beneficiary under a trust, a copy of the trust settlement agreement and copies of the trust’s three most recent financial statements; and (h) in addition to any income information that must be included under paragraphs (c) to (g), where the spouse receives income from employment insurance, social assistance, a pension, workers compensation, disability payments or any other source, the most recent statement of income indicating the total amount of income from the applicable source during the current year, or if such a statement is not provided, a letter from the appropriate authority stating the required information. [14] The respondent paid all expenses under s. 7 of the FCSG , including many of the children’s post-secondary expenses (tuition, books, flights, and set-up costs). [15] The respondent has also paid for other expenses for the children beyond s. 7 expenses. [16] Each child enjoyed living in a single family house and was able to engage in activities consistent with the best interests of the child. As noted, the parties lived close by in a single family home neighbourhood. Until May 2017, the parties enjoyed a co-operative parenting relationship, including adjusting child support as a child switched residences. [17] Between 2009 and 2016, several changes were made to the monthly child support the respondent paid as a result of the changing living arrangements of one or more of the children. The changes were by agreement following conversations between the parties. A formal review under section 31 of the SA was not engaged. The changes were not documented by the parties. [18] Neither party produced annually the documents required under section 8(1) of the SA, including “the documents required under s. 21(1) of the Federal Child Support Guidelines ”. [19] On August 29, 2017, the claimant filed an application for an order that the respondent provide his financial information from 2009 onwards in accordance with section 8 of the SA. [20] By August 31, 2017, the respondent had provided many of the documents he was required to provide under section 8(1)(a) of the SA. The claimant’s initial request made on or about June 22, 2017 was for “the last two years”. [21] On September 21, 2018, the claimant filed the current application seeking retroactive child support. On November 14, 2018, the respondent provided additional documents. The claimant is not seeking further financial documents from the respondent in relation to section 8(1)(a) of the SA. [22] For the scheduled November 2019 assize hearing, the claimant did not provide all of the documents she was required to produce under section 8(1)(a) of the SA (with reference to s. 21(1) of the FCSG ). [23] On December 5, 2019, the claimant applied to have the two-day assize hearing, which concluded November 7, 2019, re-opened in order to enter into evidence her 2009, 2014, 2015, and 2016 income tax returns. A 9 a.m. 55-minute hearing was held December 12, 2019. At this hearing, claimant’s counsel stated that the tax returns for the other relevant years would also be provided. In the claimant’s application to re-open, the claimant states that “due to error or oversight” of her counsel (Mr. MacGregor, for the November 6 and 7, 2019 hearing), the income tax returns were not provided to respondent’s counsel or entered into evidence. For the November 6 and 7, 2019 hearing, income tax summaries (not the complete returns) were provided. [24] Under the SA, the income tax returns were required to have been produced. [25] At the November 6 and 7, 2019 hearing, respondent’s counsel had sought greater detail. The income tax returns provide some of this detail but not necessarily all of the sought detail. The respondent’s counsel wishes to cross-examine the claimant on her income tax returns if “anything turns on it”. In light of my overall conclusion, the claimant’s income tax returns are not determinative of the matter at bar. [26] I will allow the claimant’s relevant income tax returns to be included in the evidence at this time. The income tax returns are source documents for the income tax summaries. [27] The claimant acknowledges that after August 2017, no child support is owing. Either a child was not a child of the marriage or the respondent paid support under section 7(8) of the SA. [28] In bringing her application, the claimant has not followed the dispute resolution procedure in section 31 of the SA with respect to her claim for child support. [29] The claimant says that the respondent’s failure to provide annually the requisite documents under section 8(1) of the SA is blameworthy conduct by him. It lies ill in the mouth for the claimant to make this argument where she did not provide the documents required of her under section 8(1) of the SA. [30] If the claimant had wished to seek an adjustment in child support, section 31 of the SA provided a practical way to do so without incurring from the outset litigation costs for both parties. [31] Under section 31 of the SA, the claimant was required to provide written notice. The written notice needed to state, for example, that she wished to increase child support based on the FCSG income of each party. As evidence supporting the proposed change, the claimant could have provided her relevant income tax returns (and other information under section 8 of the SA) and to the extent the respondent had not provided requisite information (such as his tax returns) to request such. The matter would then be resolved by the parties, or failing agreement, through mediation, and if mediation failed, by recourse to the Court. [32] The claimant is now seeking to enforce the SA despite not having complied with the dispute resolution process set forth in the SA. [33] The claimant does not provide a reasonable explanation for not providing her financial information or seeking the respondent’s financial information before 2017. [34] In her second affidavit, filed July 18, 2018, the claimant says: Because Rob has never provided me with financial information, and because he has never requested financial information from me except in response to my requests for such information, I have not provided him with financial information. [35] The claimant does not explain the reason she did not follow the procedure the parties agreed to under the SA for dispute resolution. [36] I will dismiss the claimant’s application on the basis that she has not followed the SA’s dispute resolution procedures. These procedures were designed to facilitate the timely and conciliatory resolution of any proposed change in child support with recourse to the Court as the last resort. The claimant is asking the Court to enforce the SA she filed with the Court, despite not following its dispute resolution procedure. [37] Absent a good reason, courts recognize separation agreements, because, among other matters, they provide certainty, reduce costs, and serve to avoid litigation. [38] In the case at bar, the law of contract applies. Recourse to the principles of estoppel is not necessary: B. MacDougall, Estoppel (2nd ed) LexisNexis Canada Inc., 2019, at para. 2:23. [39] In dismissing the claimant’s application, I am mindful that child support is the right of the child. [40] If the claimant had in any particular year thought the children’s needs were not sufficiently funded, she could have given notice under section 31(2) of the SA. As noted, the claimant and the respondent were living in separate nearby houses with a co-operative parenting relationship, including adjusting child support as a child switched residences. Each child was raised in a supportive environment. [41] With respect to a supportive environment, I note that when one of the children was 16 years of age and had a particularly serious problem that caused the claimant to be justifiably upset with the child, the respondent helped by having the child live with him. Similarly, when one of the other children wished to live with the claimant full-time as a result of a curfew dispute with the respondent, the child lived with the claimant. [42] In M.A.M. v. D.L.L. , 2018 BCSC 2114, Justice Ker summarized the court’s discretion to make a retroactive child support order. Justice Ker stated: [90] The discretion to make an order of retroactive child support is found in ss. 15.1 and 17 of the Divorce Act , R.S.C. 1985, c. 3 (2nd Supp.) and ss. 152 or 170(b) of the FLA (depending on whether it is a variation order or not). The circumstances in which retroactive child support may be awarded were addressed in [ D.B.S. v. S.R.G ., 2006 SCC 7]. The Supreme Court of Canada directed trial judges to adopt a broad and holistic approach in the application of four factors, summarized at para. 133, none of which is determinative on its own: · Is there a reasonable excuse for why support was not sought earlier? · Was there any blameworthy conduct on the part of the payor parent? · Is a retroactive award appropriate in light of the child’s past and present circumstances? · Will a retroactive award cause hardship to the payor parent or to his or her other children? [43] The claimant does not have a reasonable excuse for not seeking increased child support sooner. She had before her the SA which provided a cost-conscious dispute resolution procedure. [44] With the SA dispute resolution procedure available to the claimant and with the needs of each of the parties’ children apparently addressed as the years passed, I do not find the respondent to be blameworthy. [45] With respect to the past and present circumstances of each child, I do not see a particular reason for retroactive child support. Each child was raised in an emotionally and financially supportive environment and each is currently well-positioned for the future. [46] Finally, although a retroactive award would not necessarily cause hardship to the respondent, I am satisfied there is prejudice. Individuals need certainty in planning their financial affairs. A retroactive award undermines that certainty. Further, in the case at bar, the respondent paid all of the children’s s. 7 expenses. It would be difficult for him to now show all of the past s. 7 expenditures he has made since July 2009. Accordingly, the respondent is not readily in a position to prove all of the s. 7 expenditures he has made in order to be in a position to defend against an award of child support for past years. [47] The claimant’s application is dismissed. [48] The respondent is the successful party on the application. He is awarded his reasonable costs and disbursements for a matter of ordinary difficulty. “Funt J.”"},"meta":{},"created_at":"2022-03-03T02:25:43.696322Z","updated_at":"2022-03-03T17:02:00.244198Z","project":1},{"id":11,"annotations":[{"id":17,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"start":0,"end":36,"text":"COURT OF APPEAL FOR BRITISH COLUMBIA","labels":["COURT_NAME"]},"id":"P7akX08NzY","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":47,"end":74,"text":"Malak v.

Counsel for the Respondents: R.A. McConchie Written Submissions Received: November 6, 20, 26, and 29, 2019 Place and Date of Judgment: Vancouver, British Columbia January 7, 2020 Supplementary Reasons of the Court Summary: Application with respect to costs. Four appellants were found jointly and severally liable for defamation. Three of them appealed together and the fourth appealed separately. The appeals, which raised different issues, were heard together and allowed in part. The three appellants succeeded on most of their issues while the remaining appellant had very limited success. A new trial was ordered on limited issues. Held: As the three appellants were substantially successful they were entitled to costs on their appeal. It was not appropriate to make the fourth appellant responsible for those costs by means of a Sanderson order or a Bullock order. Supplementary Reasons for Judgment of the Court: [1] In reasons for judgment indexed as Malak v. Hanna , 2019 BCCA 106, we dealt with two appeals brought by four appellants from a trial in which they were found jointly and severally liable with respect to numerous publications of defamatory statements. The trial judge found those appellants had engaged in a campaign of vilification against the respondents, Raoul Malak and his companies. The first appeal was brought by Philip Keith Jackman, Trevor Paine, and Valley Traffic Systems Inc. (“VTS”) (CA44856). Mr. Jackman owns VTS and Mr. Paine is its vice-president. The second appeal was brought by Remon Hanna (CA44858). The appeals were heard together. Both were allowed in part. [2] These reasons concern the issue of costs in CA44856. For convenience we will refer to the respondents in that appeal collectively as “Mr. Malak”. [3] Messrs. Jackman and Paine and VTS take the position they are entitled to costs on their appeal. Mr. Malak takes the following alternative positions: (a) as success was divided, the parties should bear their own costs; (b) as a new trial was ordered on the basis of the adequacy of the trial judge’s reasons, the parties should bear their own costs; (c) if Messrs. Jackman and Paine and VTS are entitled to costs, then costs should be apportioned on a percentage-of-success basis and set off; (d) if Messrs. Jackman and Paine and VTS are entitled to costs, then a Sanderson order should be made against Mr. Hanna requiring him to pay those costs (see Sanderson v. Blyth Theatre Co. , [1903] 2 K.B. 533 (C.A.)); and (e) if Messrs. Jackman and Paine and VTS are entitled to costs from Mr. Malak, then a Bullock order should be made against Mr. Hanna allowing Mr. Malak to recover those costs as a disbursement in CA44858 (see Bullock v. London General Omnibus Co. , [1907] 1 K.B. 264 (C.A.)). [4] In our reasons allowing the appeals in part, we: (a) set aside all the liability findings against Mr. Paine and VTS, and all but one of the liability findings against Mr. Jackman; and (b) ordered a new trial limited to whether VTS is vicariously liable for Mr. Hanna’s actions and whether Mr. Jackman and Mr. Paine are liable for those actions on the basis they participated with Mr. Hanna in a common design. [5] We consider this outcome to constitute substantial success by Mr. Jackman, Mr. Paine, and VTS. It is well-established that a party that achieves substantial success on appeal is entitled to costs and that substantial success does not require success of all issues: Doucette v. McInnes , 2012 BCCA 235 at para. 19, 322 B.C.A.C. 170; Stein v. Stein , 2007 BCCA 187 at para. 8, 68 B.C.L.R. (4th) 104; Canadian Centre for Bio-Ethical Reform v. South Coast British Columbia Transportation Authority , 2018 BCCA 440 at paras. 4–6, 18 B.C.L.R. (6th) 375. [6] In support of his submission that the parties should bear their own costs, Mr. Malak cites Ciolli v. Galley , 2011 BCCA 106 at para. 34, 302 B.C.A.C. 15. Ms. Ciolli was injured in several motor vehicle accidents and the damages actions she commenced were tried together. This Court allowed the defendants’ appeals and ordered a new trial on the ground that the trial judge erred in not giving the jury an even-handed summary of the evidence or adequate instructions. The Court further held that the “fairest course” was to order the parties to bear their own costs of the appeal. However, as pointed out in Harder v. Poettcker , 2017 BCCA 107 at para. 8, 96 B.C.L.R. (5th) 242, the result in Ciolli was that the parties were returned to “square one”. That is not the result of the appeal in the present matter. [7] As to a Sanderson or Bullock order, we would not exercise our discretion to make Mr. Hanna responsible for the costs awarded against Mr. Malak in CA44856. This is because Mr. Hanna did nothing to warrant his having to pay those costs: see Grassi v. WIC Radio Ltd. , 2001 BCCA 376 at paras. 33, 89 B.C.L.R. (3d) 198; Moore v. Wienecke , 2008 BCCA 162 at paras. 44–50, (2008), 290 D.L.R. (4th) 509. Of note is that the two appeals raised different issues. The only common issues were the challenges to the findings of common design and vicarious liability. However, in that regard, Mr. Hanna did no more than adopt the arguments advanced by Messrs. Jackman and Paine and VTS. [8] In the result, we order costs in favour of Messrs. Jackman and Paine and VTS in CA44856. In addition, we order that Mr. Hanna is entitled to set off his costs relating to this application against the costs ordered against him in CA44858. “The Honourable Mr. Justice Frankel” “The Honourable Mr. Justice Goepel” “The Honourable Madam Justice Griffin”"},"meta":{},"created_at":"2022-03-03T02:25:43.696201Z","updated_at":"2022-03-03T07:18:52.205967Z","project":1},{"id":10,"annotations":[{"id":16,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"start":0,"end":37,"text":"COURT OF APPEAL FOR BRITISH COLUMBIA ","labels":["COURT_NAME"]},"id":"-eOQmgfZMA","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":47,"end":70,"text":"Li v.

OF APPEAL FOR BRITISH COLUMBIA Citation: Li v.

Rao , 2018 BCSC 142, Vancouver Docket E170206). Oral Reasons for Judgment Counsel for the Appellant: P.R. Albi, Q.C. M.A. Clemens, Q.C J. Parker Counsel for the Respondent: B.B. Olthuis A.C. Bjornson Place and Date of Hearing: Vancouver, British Columbia January 23, 2019 Place and Date of Judgment: Vancouver, British Columbia January 30, 2019 Summary: Application to stay two appeals pending the resolution of a related action in the court (“Settlement Action”). Held: application dismissed. The parties have brought a multiplicity of proceedings in multiple jurisdictions, and it is not clear that resolution of the Settlement Action would end the litigation. Since the appeals are not brought from orders in the Settlement Action, the concern of avoiding litigating in slices does not weigh as heavily in favour of staying the appeals pending its resolution. Further, the respondent’s appeals can be heard expeditiously. As a result, the prejudice to the respondent from the delay in hearing the appeals if the stay is granted outweighs the prejudice to the applicant from having to respond to the appeals while the Settlement Action continues. [1] FENLON J.A. : The respondent Peipei Li applies to have two appeals stayed pending resolution of an action in the Supreme Court to enforce a settlement. Ms. Li asserts that the parties entered into a comprehensive settlement in March 2018 resolving all matters between them. [2] The appellant Lu Hua Rao is a businessman residing in China, and Ms. Li is a businesswoman residing in Vancouver. The two are currently parties to at least six different legal proceedings, all arising out of essentially the same factual background and seeking overlapping relief. [3] In or about August 2015 the parties commenced a romantic relationship and eventually underwent a marriage ceremony in Las Vegas, even though Mr. Rao was already married. He says he told Ms. Li he was married and would not leave his wife and two sons, but went through with the marriage ceremony because Ms. Li told him a Las Vegas marriage hardly had any effect and would help them to get mortgage financing for their real estate venture and assist with immigration. For her part, Ms. Li says it was a bona fide marriage and she was later shocked and distressed to discover Mr. Rao was already married in China. [4] On the business side of their relationship, the parties incorporated LPP Properties Inc. (“LPP”), and each received 50% of the shares. They agreed that Mr. Rao would contribute $20 million to the company for his shares and Ms. Li would contribute $1,000. Mr. Rao actually invested $17.65 million. Those funds were distributed to an account controlled jointly by the parties and to an account held by Ms. Li personally. The transfers occurred by way of promissory notes and directions to pay executed by Mr. Rao. [5] The parties’ relationship collapsed in acrimony in late 2016. They immediately became embroiled in a series of proceedings all of which arose out of their relationship and business dealings. Central to their disputes is whether Ms. Li used the $17.65 million invested by Mr. Rao in accordance with the parties’ agreement. [6] The proceedings are as follows: · In December 2016 Mr. Rao commenced a civil proceeding (the Civil Claim) in Supreme Court claiming that Ms. Li had transferred and used LPP funds without his knowledge and contrary to their agreement. · In January 2017 Ms. Li commenced a family proceeding in Supreme Court seeking a divorce, support and division of family property (the Family Claim). Mr. Rao filed a counterclaim in that proceeding. · Early in 2017 Ms. Li also commenced proceedings in China alleging Mr. Rao had committed bigamy. That led to criminal proceedings against Mr. Rao by the Chinese government. · In March 2017 Mr. Rao started a family action in China seeking a declaration that the Las Vegas marriage was a nullity. · In June 2017 Mr. Rao commenced an arbitration in China under the terms of the parties’ agreement which provided for resolution of disputes in that forum (the CIETAC arbitration). In that proceeding he seeks return of the funds advanced to the company and does not mention the romantic component of his relationship with Ms. Li. · Finally, Mr. Rao commenced an action in the Supreme Court advancing the same civil claim and seeking the same relief as the CIETAC arbitration, under s. 9 of the International Commercial Arbitration Act , R.S.B.C. 1996, c. 233 as an interim measure of protection to toll the limitation period given Ms. Li’s jurisdictional challenge to the CIETAC arbitration. [7] In March 2018 the parties met in person in Hong Kong. Ms. Li asserts they came to a settlement, but Mr. Rao backed out of that agreement in late April 2018 when he realized the significant tax consequences flowing from the terms agreed to. [8] In August 2018 Ms. Li commenced civil proceedings in the Supreme Court to enforce the settlement (the Settlement Claim). The terms of the settlement asserted by Ms. Li are as follows: (1) Mr. Rao would receive the balance of the company funds remaining, amounting to approximately $8 million; (2) Ms. Li would receive the Vancouver residential property that was purchased with some of the funds, free and clear of any claim by Mr. Rao; (3) Mr. Rao would remove any liens or other encumbrances he had caused to be placed on the Vancouver residential property; (4) Ms. Li would receive Mr. Rao’s shares in the company and all of the company’s remaining assets; and (5) The parties would withdraw any and all claims made against the other including the Family Claim, the Civil Claim, and the CIETAC arbitration. [9] I turn now to the two appeals Ms. Li seeks to stay. The first, Appeal CA45103, is from an order of Madam Justice Forth made in the Family Claim on January 30, 2018. Justice Forth declared the marriage to be void ab initio , but dismissed Mr. Rao’s November 2017 application to strike Ms. Li’s claim for division of family property and spousal support. [10] The second, Appeal CA45061, is from the order of Mr. Justice Funt, also in the Family Claim, made January 12, 2018 enjoining Mr. Rao from taking any further steps in the CIETAC arbitration and enjoining him from requiring Ms. Li to take any steps in that proceeding without leave of the Supreme Court. This order effectively prevented Mr. Rao from withdrawing the Civil Claim and proceeding only with the arbitration. [11] As I have noted, Ms. Li applies for stay of the appeals pending determination of the Settlement Action which she says would resolve all proceedings between the parties, including the Family Claim underlying the orders under appeal, thereby rendering the appeals moot. [12] A single justice may grant a stay of an appeal proceeding pending the occurrence of a certain event, such as the decision of another body, pursuant to subparagraphs 10(2)(a) and (b) of the Court of Appeal Act , R.S.B.C. 1996, c. 77 : Hollander v. Nelson , 2013 BCCA 83 at paras. 14, 21 (D. Smith J.A. in Chambers), citing Taga Ku Development Corp. v. Yukon Territory (1995), 55 B.C.A.C. 266 (Legg J.A. in Chambers). [13] There are two principles animating a decision whether to stay an appeal pending a decision from another body, such as a trial court: Habitat for Humanity Canada v. Hearts and Hands for Homes Society , 2015 BCCA 443 at para. 24. The first concerns the public interest in the efficient use of judicial resources and avoiding “litigating in slices”: Habitat for Humanity at para. 24; Hollander at paras. 25–27. The second is balancing the prejudice between the parties. The Court must ask whether the prejudice from a delay in completing the proceedings in the court below to the party applying for the stay outweighs the prejudice to the other party of a delay in hearing the appeal: Habitat for Humanity at para. 25; Taga Ku at para. 14. [14] This test may respond more flexibly to the considerations relevant to deciding whether to stay an appeal itself as opposed to an order appealed from than the traditional three-part inquiry from RJR-MacDonald Inc. v. Canada (Attorney General) , [1994] 1 S.C.R. 311: Korea Data Systems (USA), Inc. v. Aamazing Technologies Inc. , 2012 ONCA 756 at para. 19. [15] Ms. Li submits that, by any measure, six proceedings dealing with the same set of circumstances and seeking overlapping relief does not amount to an efficient use of judicial resources. She argues that, irrespective of the outcome, the two appeals will not serve to conclude the dispute between the parties — one, if successful, will lead to the CIETAC arbitration intensifying, and the other, while striking the property and spousal support claims from the Family Claim, would leave to be resolved the constructive trust claims advanced both by Ms. Li and by Mr. Rao’s counterclaim in that action. [16] Ms. Li asserts that if the Settlement Action is permitted to proceed while everything else is held in abeyance, it could resolve all of the disputes in the proceedings between the parties. In relation to balancing prejudice, she submits that if the Settlement Action is unsuccessful, Mr. Rao can simply resume his appeals, whereas if she is required to go through the appeals, the cases will continue and she will be left to battle through various proceedings as well as the Settlement Action, incurring significant costs. Given the history of the litigation between the parties, she stresses that further appeals may follow. [17] The application for stays of appeal in this case differs from the stays sought in Habitat , Hollander , and Taga Ku , all of which involved the staying of an appeal until matters in the single underlying cause of action could be completed. The arguments in those cases therefore focused on the disadvantage of litigating in slices, described by Southin J.A. in Digital.Doc Services (Canada) Inc. v. Future Chop Ltd. (1998), 49 B.C.L.R. (3d) 78 (C.A.): [5] It is obvious to us that what is happening here is what I have called before “litigating in slices” and that form of litigating may result in several matters coming before this Court at different times relating to this obviously highly contested litigation. It is not in the public interest that several panels of this Court should have to deal with several little bits of a lawsuit now and then and here and about. Therefore, we are going to stay of the proceedings now pending in this Court. When Madam Justice Baker has handed down her judgment, the parties will have to consider how to put all of these matters together in an appropriate way so that the time of this Court which belongs to the public and not to us, will not be wasted this way. [Emphasis added.] [18] In contrast, the parties before me are engaged in multiple proceedings in various forums and countries. They appear to have adopted a strategy of litigation warfare on both sides and on all fronts. In this context, a ceasefire to enable the Settlement Action to run its course and potentially end the war by resolving all of the extant proceedings is attractive. The saving in court time and costs to the parties tends to staying the appeals to permit the Settlement Action to be determined. However, there are a number of other considerations that tend to the contrary view. [19] First, I begin by noting that it is not plain on the record before me that Ms. Li is likely to succeed in proving the settlement she asserts. Her own lawyer, in forwarding a draft form of agreement to Mr. Rao’s lawyer, referred to the parties having agreed to a framework for settlement. Although it is possible that Ms. Li will be successful, again, I restrict my remarks to the record I have before me — that of course cannot be assumed, and even if successful at trial, an appeal could well follow. If Ms. Li is not successful, Mr. Rao will have been delayed considerably in his pursuit of the $17.5 million he invested in LPP. [20] Second, and more significantly, the Settlement Action is only at the pleadings stage. Ms. Li has filed a notice of civil claim and Mr. Rao is in the process of preparing his response. Although Ms. Li submits the entire case could be dealt with within a year, that seems improbable. As I see it, there is no prospect of the Settlement Action being resolved expeditiously given the inherent complexity in such an action – many documents will have to be translated from Mandarin, Mr. Rao lives in China and can only proceed through an interpreter, and there is a prospect of a third party proceeding. In addition, there is little reason to anticipate the parties will depart from their aggressive approach to litigation. [21] In contrast, the appeal in the Family Claim from Justice Forth’s order is ready to proceed. All factums and books have been filed and it could be heard within a few months. If that appeal succeeds, it will dispose of a significant portion of the Family Claim and remove a layer of complexity raised by the romantic component of the parties’ relationship. [22] I also take into account the timing of Ms. Li’s application for a stay of Mr. Rao’s two appeals. As I have noted, the appeal in the Family Claim is ready to be heard. The appeal from the order of Justice Funt freezing the CIETAC proceedings is at an early stage but leave was applied for in January 2018 and obtained in May 2018 without Ms. Li raising the settlement she now asserts occurred in April. Mr. Rao incurred the expense of that leave to appeal application and filed his appeal record on July 23, 2018, all before Ms. Li commenced the Settlement Action in August 2018 and applied for a stay. [23] Mr. Rao intends to apply to have the two appeals heard at the same time and based on much of the same record. If Mr. Rao succeeds on appeal, he will be able to continue with the CIETAC arbitration. If the arbitrator assumes jurisdiction of the contractual disputes, many of the issues between the parties will be resolved outside of this jurisdiction. [24] Taking all of these factors into account, and in particular: · the length of time the appeals will have to be stayed until the Settlement Action can be concluded; · Ms. Li’s failure to proceed expeditiously to seek a stay of the appeals after Mr. Rao denied a settlement had occurred; and · the steps taken by Mr. Rao in the appeals which are close to ready to proceed; I am of the view that the prejudice to Mr. Rao in delaying the completion of the appeals in this Court outweighs the prejudice to Ms. Li of requiring her to respond to them. I therefore dismiss the applications to stay both appeals. “The Honourable Madam Justice Fenlon”"},"meta":{},"created_at":"2022-03-03T02:25:43.696143Z","updated_at":"2022-03-03T03:58:52.123480Z","project":1},{"id":9,"annotations":[{"id":15,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"start":3,"end":40,"text":"THE SUPREME COURT OF BRITISH COLUMBIA","labels":["COURT_NAME"]},"id":"oaoI1TTjL_","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":51,"end":82,"text":"Herrera v.

Miller, 2020 BCSC 62 Date: 20200108 Docket: M1811642 Registry: Vancouver Between: Willard Herrera Plaintiff And Marilyn Louise Miller and John Torrance Miller Defendants Before: The Honourable Mr. Justice Giaschi Oral Reasons for Judgment In Chambers Counsel for the Plaintiff: V. Sewell Counsel for the Defendants: C. Carey Place and Dates of Hearing: Vancouver, B.C. January 7 and 8, 2020 Place and Date of Judgment: Vancouver, B.C. January 8, 2020 [1] THE COURT: I will deliver my reasons now. I reserve the right to amend these reasons for grammar and clarity, and to include full citations and quotations. The result will not change as a consequence of any such amendments. [2] The plaintiff was involved in a motor vehicle accident on November 2, 2017, in which he alleges that he suffered injuries, including to the back, shoulder and neck and that he suffers from chronic pain, headaches, sleeplessness and anxiety. The defendants now apply to have this matter transferred to the Provincial Small Claims Court. The effect of the transfer, if ordered, will be to limit the plaintiff’s claim in damages to $35,000. [3] The governing statutory provision is s. 15 of the Supreme Court Act, R.S.B.C. 1996, c. 443: 15 A judge or master may transfer proceedings to the Provincial Court of British Columbia if (a) the proceedings are within the jurisdiction of the Provincial Court under the Small Claims Act, (b) a party to the proceedings applies to the judge or master, or all parties to the proceedings agree to the transfer, and (c) the judge or master considers it appropriate to do so. [4] Also relevant is Rule 14‑1 (10) of the Supreme Court Civil Rules , B.C. Reg 168\/2009, which provides that if a plaintiff recovers an amount in the Supreme Court that is within the monetary jurisdiction of the Provincial Court, the plaintiff is not entitled to costs except disbursements, unless the court finds that there was sufficient reason for bringing the matter in the Supreme Court: Costs in cases within small claims jurisdiction (10) A plaintiff who recovers a sum within the jurisdiction of the Provincial Court under the Small Claims Act is not entitled to costs, other than disbursements, unless the court finds that there was sufficient reason for bringing the proceeding in the Supreme Court and so orders. [5] The appropriate test under s. 15 is two-fold: first, is the proceeding sought to be transferred within the jurisdiction of the Provincial Court?; and second, is transfer appropriate in the circumstances?: Cort v. Insurance Corporation of British Columbia , 2011 BCSC 586. [6] With respect to the first step in the test, the defendants submit that this matter is within the jurisdiction of the Provincial Court as the damages cannot be more than $35,000. They submit that the motor vehicle accident was relatively minor, that the plaintiff suffered insignificant injuries for which he received very little treatment, and that the injuries did not seriously affect the plaintiff’s enjoyment of recreational and sporting activities, or his employment. The defendants rely heavily upon the evidence of the plaintiff given at his examination for discovery. [7] With respect to the second part of the test, there are a number of factors that can be considered, including delay, the need for Supreme Court pre-trial procedures, the availability of jury trials, and the complexity of the case. [8] The plaintiff submits that the pain suffered as a consequence of his injuries is now chronic, that he attends massage therapy to manage his pain and plans to have chiropractic treatments to further address his symptoms. [9] Both parties have referred me to case law relating to the assessment of damages. [10] The defendant refers me to Sidor v. Coulter , 2013 BCPC 0011, and the cases cited therein in support of their submission that the plaintiff’s damages in this matter will not exceed $35,000. [11] In contrast, the plaintiff refers me to several cases: Harry v. Powar , 2018 BCSC 845, Poulin v. Armstrong , 2019 BCSC 926 and Carson v. Ehman , 2019 BCSC 2120 where they say the plaintiffs had similar injuries and were awarded more than $35,000 in damages. [12] The plaintiff filed an affidavit sworn December 13, 2019. In that affidavit, he deposes that, as a result of the accident, he continues to experience symptoms in his back, shoulders and right hip, and has difficulty sleeping. He complains of pain in his lower back and shoulders when not active, and of pain lasting two to three days if he engages in activities. He further deposed to having difficulty falling asleep and of waking in the night because of lower back pain. He further deposed to attending massage therapy on a more or less weekly basis and that he intends to seek chiropractic treatments. [13] In approaching this mater, I am particularly mindful of the caution expressed by Justice McEwan in Kooner v. Singh , 2011 BCSC 1384, at paras. 3 and 6. There, he stated it is only in the clearest of cases that a matter should be transferred to the Provincial Court. It is only where there is no possibility of a damage award exceeding the Small Claims’ limit that a matter should be transferred to the Provincial Court: [3] I have commented on other occasions about these applications. They amount to the Supreme Court being asked to summarily determine that damages could not possibly exceed $25,000 and also to accept that a trial in Provincial Court is the most expeditious way to deal with the action. On the basis of the material before me, it is not possible to say that the case could not exceed $25,000. The plaintiff wishes to have the matter heard in Supreme Court, and it would only be on the clearest basis that the court would act to deprive a person who wished to be heard in the Supreme Court of the right to do so. … [6] I have said as much on the previous occasion of Chang v. Wren in oral reasons given June 10, 2011. I see no reason to stray from the outcome in that case which was to the effect that unless the court were persuaded that damages could not possibly exceed $25,000 the plaintiff should not be deprived of the opportunity to convince a court that their damages exceed that amount. I considered it most unsafe to summarily decide a case on the basis of descriptions that do not include the actual evidence of the parties. Courts certainly have the experience of being persuaded that cases that did not appear to be worth a great deal turn out to be worth much more once they have been heard. I will also say, as I said in Chang v. Wren, that I am absolutely not persuaded by any efficiency or cost-saving argument, particularly where, as here, the application is brought at a point post-discovery. There is very little process to avoid at this point and, for the reasons I have already indicated, it is not at all clear that there are cost savings to be realized. [14] The plaintiff is relatively young. He apparently had no medical issues prior to the accident. He apparently suffered soft tissue injuries in the accident to the neck, back and shoulders, and continues to suffer from what may be chronic pain which may encumber him for the rest of his life. He also has ongoing sleep difficulties and his injuries have affected his enjoyment of recreational activities. The injuries suffered by the plaintiff and the effects of those injuries are somewhat similar to what is described in Poulin and Carson , where the plaintiffs were awarded general damages of considerably in excess of $35,000. [15] In my view, on the basis of the evidence before me and the authorities, there is a possibility that the plaintiff may recover damages at trial in excess of $35,000. Accordingly, this matter should not be transferred to the Provincial Court, and the application is dismissed. [16] Costs, counsel? [17] MS. SEWELL: We would seek costs in any event, My Lord. [18] MS. CAREY: And our submission is costs in the cause, Your Honour. Or any such thing as you see fit. [19] THE COURT: Costs of this application shall be to the plaintiff. [20] MS. SEWELL: Can the costs be fixed, or should we deal with that later on? [21] THE COURT: You can deal with that at the trial, depending on how matters work out. I should make it clear that my costs order is, if the plaintiff recovers more than $35,000 at trial, that the plaintiff will be entitled to his costs of this application. [22] MS. SEWELL: Thank you, My Lord. [23] MS. CAREY: My Lord, if I may, can it be $35,000 at a settlement perhaps, and not just at trial, in case the matter settles before trial. [24] THE COURT: No, you can deal with that in your settlement if you decide to settle. [25] MS. CAREY: Thank you, My Lord. “Giaschi J.”"},"meta":{},"created_at":"2022-03-03T02:25:43.696052Z","updated_at":"2022-03-03T03:08:02.320212Z","project":1},{"id":8,"annotations":[{"id":14,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"start":0,"end":36,"text":"COURT OF APPEAL FOR BRITISH COLUMBIA","labels":["COURT_NAME"]},"id":"KBIWeaj1qX","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":47,"end":84,"text":"Hellberg v.

Netherclift, 2019 BCCA 24 Date: 20190122 Docket: CA45208 Between: Lucy Hellberg Respondent (Claimant) And Simon Netherclift Appellant (Respondent) Before: The Honourable Mr. Justice Frankel The Honourable Mr. Justice Tysoe The Honourable Madam Justice Griffin Supplementary Reasons to: Hellberg v. Netherclift , 2018 BCCA 404. Counsel for the Appellant: S.G.L. Label Counsel for the Respondent: A.S. Perello Place and Date of Hearing: Vancouver, British Columbia September 24, 2018 Place and Date of Judgment: Vancouver, British Columbia October 31, 2018 Written Submissions Received: November 15, 21 and 23, 2018 January 15, 2019 Date of Supplementary Judgment January 22, 2019 Supplementary Reasons of the Court Summary: After the appellant’s appeal was dismissed, the respondent seeks special costs of the appeal proceedings and trial below. Held: Application for special costs dismissed. The central issue on appeal was whether the parties’ child would primarily live with the respondent in the UK or with the appellant in Canada. The respondent did not cross appeal the ordinary costs order at the appeal, therefore , this Court will not interfere with that order. Further, the respondent has not established that the appellant misconducted himself in the conduct of this appeal. The respondent made a settlement offer but it was not unreasonable for the appellant to not accept it given the importance of the child’s primary residence to the parties. The respondent is entitled to her costs of the appeal on a party and party basis. The appellant is entitled to costs of the application for special costs. Supplementary Reasons for Judgment of the Court: [1] These supplemental reasons concern whether this Court should award special costs in this Court and in the court below against the appellant, Mr. Netherclift, in favour of the successful respondent, Ms. Hellberg. [2] In our reasons for judgment in this appeal, indexed as 2018 BCCA 404, this Court dismissed Mr. Netherclift’s appeal from the order of the trial judge, which: (1) granted Ms. Hellberg sole custody of the parties’ child and permitted her to relocate permanently to the United Kingdom with the child; and (2) provided Mr. Netherclift joint guardianship and access to the child. [3] Ms. Hellberg now applies for a variety of costs orders, including orders that Mr. Netherclift pay special costs in relation to certain proceedings in this Court and the court below. She argues that special costs are justified because Mr. Netherclift misled this Court, in an earlier appeal, as to facts that went to the inquiry into the best interests of the child. [4] The trial judge below, in reasons indexed at 2018 BCSC 357, found Mr. Netherclift to have misled this Court but did not award special costs. Ms. Hellberg was entitled to her ordinary costs. [5] Ms. Hellberg did not cross appeal the costs award made at trial. [6] It is not for this Court to change a costs order made in the court below unless that issue was made an issue in this Court: Hill v. British Columbia (Minister of Forests) , 1999 BCCA 305 at para. 5. [7] As a result, the only question is whether we should depart from the usual costs order in the appeal we heard. [8] Mr. Netherclift’s conduct of the appeal was not outrageous or scandalous. [9] The fact that this matter involved somewhat protracted litigation and gave rise to two appeals is not ideal. Considering the underlying facts, however, this case falls into the category of unfortunate as opposed to an abuse of process. [10] The central issue of where the parties’ child might live was of vital importance to both parties. [11] Further, we find that Ms. Hellberg’s offer to settle is not one that this Court should consider in awarding costs. Considering that her offer required the child to relocate to the UK, it was not unreasonable for Mr. Netherclift to oppose it. Both parties are good parents. Because of the parties’ desire to live in different countries, their positions could not be easily resolved by compromise. [12] We do not consider that the evidence supports a conclusion that the usual rule as to costs will cause Mr. Netherclift hardship or that it will upset the balance between the parties. Nor would awarding party and party costs to Ms. Hellberg cause an unjust result to her. [13] In conclusion, we do not find any reason for departing from the usual order that costs follow the event.

Doan , 2019 BCCA 350, Vancouver Docket CA46332). Oral Reasons for Judgment Counsel for the Appellant: J.E. Shragge Counsel for the Respondent: R. Wilson M. Wilson Place and Date of Hearing: Vancouver, British Columbia January 8, 2020 Place and Date of Judgment: Vancouver, British Columbia January 8, 2020 Summary: Application to vary an order made by a single justice in chambers that an order confirming a sale is a limited appeal order under R. 2.1 of the Court of Appeal Rules. Held: Application dismissed. The order was made under R. 21‑7 of the Supreme Court Civil Rules [foreclosure and cancellation] even though an order absolute had been obtained in the foreclosure proceeding. [1] TYSOE J.A. : The applicant, Scott Lawson Doan, applies under s. 9(6) of the Court of Appeal Act , R.S.B.C. 1996, c. 77, to vary an order made by a single justice of this Court in chambers on October 18, 2019. The justice held that the order the applicant wishes to appeal is a limited appeal order under R. 2.1 of the Court of Appeal Rules , B.C. Reg. 297\/2001, on the basis that it was granted under R. 21‑7 [foreclosure and cancellation] of the Supreme Court Civil Rules , B.C. Reg. 168\/2009. Mr. Doan therefore required leave of the Court to appeal the order, and the justice concluded that it was not in the interests of justice to grant leave. [2] The order which Mr. Doan wishes to appeal is an order made by Master Dick on July 24, 2019, approving a sale of property owned and occupied by Mr. Doan. The sale has completed and the property is now registered in the name of the third‑party purchaser. [3] The property was subject to a mortgage granted by Mr. Doan in favour of the Scotia Mortgage Corporation and insured by the respondent, Genworth Financial Mortgage Insurance Company Canada (“Genworth Financial”). Default was made under the mortgage in January 2016, and Scotia Mortgage Corporation commenced a foreclosure proceeding. On October 28, 2016, Scotia Mortgage Corporation obtained an order nisi , as well as an order for conduct of sale effective December 5, 2016. The amount required to redeem the mortgage at the time was approximately $174,000 plus interest at the approximate rate of 3%. [4] The property was listed for sale at a listing price of approximately $210,000. An offer of $170,000 was received, but it was not accepted. [5] In November 2016, Genworth Financial paid the amount owed to Scotia Mortgage Corporation and took an assignment of the mortgage and the foreclosure proceeding. On November 29, 2017, Genworth Financial was substituted as the petitioner in the foreclosure proceeding, and it also obtained an order absolute at the same time. Mr. Doan appealed the order absolute in the Supreme Court but, before the appeal was heard, the parties entered into an agreement dealing with the appeal and listing of the property for sale. [6] The agreement was contained in a letter dated July 3, 2018, from Genworth Financial’s lawyer to Mr. Doan. It was agreed that Mr. Doan’s appeal would be dismissed, that Mr. Doan would be entitled to list the property for sale for approximately three months and that, if an offer in an amount sufficient to pay off the mortgage was not received by September 30, 2018, Genworth Financial would “proceed with listing the Property for sale under its conduct of sale order.” The agreement also provided that if Mr. Doan did not cooperate with Genworth Financial’s realtor or was in breach of other terms of the agreement, it would file the order absolute in the land title office. [7] No suitable offer was received by Mr. Doan, and Genworth Financial re‑listed the property for sale. It accepted an offer in the amount of $185,000 and applied within the foreclosure proceeding for court approval of the sale. [8] On July 24, 2019, Master Dick approved the sale at the $185,000 offered price. She noted that the property had been appraised to have a value of $205,000 as at April 30, 2019, but given the marketing history, she concluded that the offer was provident. Master Dick also noted that Mr. Doan would have to come up with close to $210,000 to retain the property. In light of the fact that Genworth Financial could not have sought to recover any shortfall from Mr. Doan if it had “acted on the order absolute,” Master Dick made it a term of the order approving the sale that Genworth Financial was barred from pursuing Mr. Doan on his personal covenant for any shortfall on the mortgage loan. [9] Mr. Doan filed a notice of application for leave to appeal, and the matter came on before the chambers judge on September 20, 2019. At the hearing, Mr. Doan took the position that leave to appeal was not required for three reasons, and if leave to appeal was required, it was an appropriate case for leave to be granted. [10] In reasons for judgment dated October 18, 2019, and indexed as 2019 BCCA 350, the chambers judge held that leave to appeal was required and that it was not in the interests of justice to grant leave. She rejected Mr. Doan’s arguments that Master Dick’s order was made under R. 13‑5 [sales by the court] of the Supreme Court Civil Rules , rather than R. 21‑7, because: (a) the foreclosure proceeding had come to an end when the order absolute was granted; (b) the sale was made pursuant to the letter agreement dated July 3, 2018; and (c) the notice of application for the order approving the sale stated that Genworth Financial was relying on R. 13‑5 as well as R. 21‑7. [11] The chambers judge went on to consider the usual factors for determining whether it was in the interests of justice to grant leave to appeal. She concluded that it was not in the interests of justice to grant leave because Mr. Doan had not provided evidence challenging the providence of the sale and any deficiency in the form of the evidence relied upon could be remedied upon a further application. She also considered it to be of great significance that title to the property had vested in a bona fide purchaser for value before Mr. Doan filed his notice of application for leave to appeal. [12] The standard of review on an application to vary or discharge an order of a justice under s. 9(6) of the Court of Appeal Act is well established. The division hearing the application will interfere with the decision of the chambers judge only if the judge was wrong in law, or wrong in principle, or misconceived the facts: Haldorson v. Coquitlam (City) , 2000 BCCA 672 at para. 7. [13] On this review application, Mr. Doan reiterates the first of his arguments that the order approving the sale could not have been made under R. 21‑7 because the order absolute brought the foreclosure proceeding to an end and the court was functus officio. In that regard, he relies on decisions such as Federal Business Development Bank v. F.J.H. Construction Ltd. (1988), 50 D.L.R. (4th) 105 (B.C.C.A.), and Harrison v. Harrison , 2007 BCCA 120. [14] Mr. Doan says the chambers judge erred by rejecting this argument on the basis the proceeding is not at an end upon the granting of an order absolute because the mortgagor is still entitled to apply to reopen the foreclosure proceeding for the purpose of redeeming the mortgage. He submits that this is an exceptional equitable remedy which is available only to mortgagors and that Genworth Financial is not entitled to rely on it for the purpose of requiring leave to appeal to be obtained. [15] In my opinion, the flaw in Mr. Doan’s argument is that he conflates the issue of whether the order was made in the foreclosure proceeding and the issue of whether the court should not have made the order for lack of jurisdiction. There can be no doubt that the order was made in the foreclosure proceeding. The application was made by Genworth Financial within the foreclosure proceeding pursuant to the order for conduct of sale granted in the foreclosure proceeding, and the order was made by Master Dick pursuant to that application. It is clear from Master Dick’s reasons (dated July 24, 2019, and indexed as 2019 BCSC 1521) that she was exercising her power under R. 21‑7(9) to confirm a sale on an application of a person having conduct of sale in a foreclosure proceeding. Whether she erred in exercising that power for lack of jurisdiction is a different issue. [16] There was no proceeding other than the foreclosure proceeding in which the order could have been made. Master Dick was not exercising the power of the court to vest title to the property in the purchaser under R. 13‑5(7) in another proceeding because conduct of sale had not been granted in any other proceeding. [17] In determining whether the order was a limited appeal order, the issue is whether the order was granted under R. 21‑7. It is not an issue, as Mr. Doan would have it, of whether the order should have been granted under R. 21‑7. That latter issue goes to the merits of the appeal, not to the threshold issue of whether leave is required. [18] A somewhat analogous situation occurred in Mission Creek Mortgage Ltd. v. Angleland Holdings Inc. , 2013 BCCA 347. In that case, the appellant wished to appeal an order nisi on the basis that the foreclosure proceeding was null and void because notice had not been given under s. 21 of the Farm Debt Mediation Act , S.C. 1997, c. 21. This Court held that leave to appeal was required because the issue of whether the Supreme Court had the ability to make the order nisi was a matter that was determined under R. 21‑7. As in the present case, the Court decided that the issue was whether the order was granted under R. 21‑7, not whether the appellant had an argument that the Supreme Court did not have the jurisdiction to grant the order. [19] In my view, it is not necessary to address the arguments made by Genworth Financial that an order absolute is not a final order and that the letter agreement dated July 3, 2018, altered the effect of the order absolute. Nor is it necessary to consider whether leave to appeal should have been granted because Mr. Doan is not challenging the exercise of discretion by the chambers judge in refusing to grant leave, presumably because he is not able to point to any error made by her in the exercise of the discretion. [20] In conclusion, Mr. Doan has not demonstrated that the chambers judge erred in her conclusion that the order approving the sale was a limited appeal order within the meaning of R. 2.1. I would dismiss his application. [21] BAUMAN C.J.B.C. : I agree. [22] ABRIOUX J.A. : I agree. [23] BAUMAN C.J.B.C. : The application to vary is dismissed.

Corbett, 2021 BCSC 2 Date: 20210104 Docket: M33169 Registry: Chilliwack Between: James Andrew David Enns Plaintiff And Jennifer Travis Corbett and Mark Eugene Gaudio Defendants Before: The Honourable Mr. Justice Riley Reasons for Judgment Re: Costs Counsel for the Plaintiff: D.R. Lester, Q.C. Counsel for the Defendants: I. Ferbey Dates of Written Submissions: November 23, 2020 December 15, 2020 December 16, 2020 Place and Date of Judgment: Chilliwack, B.C. January 4, 2021 [1] In reasons indexed as Enns v. Corbett , 2020 BCSC 1680, I granted judgment in the plaintiff’s favour and awarded damages in the amount of $322,780.84 for personal injuries arising out of a motor vehicle collision. These are supplementary reasons for judgment dealing with costs. [2] The plaintiff asserts that as the successful party, he should receive costs of the action under Rule 14-1(9), and double costs from the date of a settlement offer made about three weeks before trial under Rule 9-1(5). The plaintiff says that even after allowing for potential deductions under s. 83 of the Insurance (Vehicle) Act , R.S.B.C. 1996, c. 231, the net amount awarded after trial is some $30,000 more than the amount proposed in his settlement offer. [3] For her part, the defendant concedes that the plaintiff is entitled to costs, but argues that this is not a proper case for double costs. The defendant disputes that the plaintiff’s settlement offer “ought reasonably to have been accepted” based on what was known at the time that it was open for acceptance. The defendant points out that the trial involved issues of both liability and quantum of damages. While the plaintiff ultimately succeeded in establishing liability, at the point when the offer was made there was room for debate regarding apportionment of liability as between the plaintiff and the defendant. [4] Rule 14-1(9) provides that the successful party is presumptively entitled to costs of the proceedings. [5] Rule 9-1 deals with the costs implications of an offer to settle. The overall purpose of this Rule is to encourage parties to seek early resolution by making settlement offers and to discourage parties from unreasonably refusing such offers. By encouraging settlement of claims at the earliest possible opportunity, the Rule provides a “winnowing function in the litigation process” which requires litigants to come to grips with the relative strength or weakness of their respective claims and defences: Hartshorne v. Hartshorne , 2011 BCCA 29 at para. 25. [6] Rule 9-1(6) sets out a list of factors that may be taken into account in deciding what costs order to make where an offer to settle was made. I will review each of these factors as they apply to this case. [7] I do not agree with the plaintiff that the offer ought reasonably to have been accepted as contemplated in Rule 9-1(6)(a). Rather, I agree with the defendant that at the time the offer was made, there was uncertainty as to the strength of the plaintiff’s claim, due in large measure to issues of contributory negligence and potential apportionment of liability. Despite the live issues as to liability, the plaintiff’s offer expressly rested on the premise that the defendant would be found “fully liable” for the collision; it made no allowance for the contingent risk that the plaintiff might be found contributorily negligent, which was a live possibility based on the evidence available to the parties when the offer was made. To quote from the defendant’s submission, the plaintiff’s offer “did not account for the real risk that the plaintiff’s claim might have been dismissed entirely or that liability might be apportioned, based on information available to the parties at the time”. As explained in Owen v. Folster , 2019 BCSC 407 at para. 12, the plaintiff’s offer did not put forward a “genuine compromise or an incentive to settle” in view of the litigation risks, such that the defendant did not act unreasonably in declining to accept it. [8] I next consider the relationship between the terms of the offer and the amount of the final judgment as contemplated in Rule 9-1(6)(b). I agree with the defendant that while the plaintiff made an offer to settle for less than the amount ultimately awarded at trial, the difference was marginal by comparison to the overall damage award. Leaving aside costs of future care, the difference between the plaintiff’s offer and the result at trial is some $30,000, which as a proportion is less than 15 percent of the total. This factor therefore does not weigh in the plaintiff’s favour as much as it would if the gap were wider. [9] I must also consider the relative financial circumstances of the parties as provided for in Rule 9-1(6)(c). On the one hand, the very fact that the defendant had insurance coverage providing a greater capacity than the plaintiff to bear the financial risks of a trial is a relevant consideration in the costs analysis: Smith v. Tedford , 2010 BCCA 302 at para. 19. On the other hand, there is no evidence that the defendant or her insurer used their financial strength in an “untoward manner” as discussed in C.P. v. RBC Life Insurance Company , 2015 BCCA 30 at para. 101-102. [10] On balance, the greater financial capacity of the defendant to assume the risks of a trial is a factor that weighs against the defendant’s position on costs, but only marginally. In this regard, the cases cited by the plaintiff under this heading are distinguishable. In White v. Wang , 2015 BCSC 1080, liability was admitted, and there was evidence that the prospect of going to trial posed “an immediate financial risk to the plaintiff”. In Vine v. Taylor , 2018 BCSC 105, liability was admitted, and the damages awarded at trial were some 2.5 times higher than an offer which the defendant ought reasonably to have accepted. [11] Neither party has cited any other considerations as contemplated in Rule 9-1(6)(d). [12] In my view, the most telling feature of this case is the fact that the offer to settle was premised on the plaintiff’s position that the defendant would be found fully liable for the collision, when there were live issues as to apportionment of liability. In these circumstances, it cannot be said that the offer “ought reasonably to have been accepted”. The other factors are less important in this particular case. The judgment obtained at trial was higher than the amount in the offer, but only marginally so as a proportion of the overall amount in issue. And, although the defendant’s insurance coverage placed her at some degree of financial advantage in terms of the decision to proceed to trial, there is no evidence that the defendant or her insurer used their financial strength in an untoward manner. The plaintiff was successful at trial and is therefore entitled to costs of the action at Scale B, but not double costs. “Riley J.”"},"meta":{},"created_at":"2022-03-02T17:19:05.435689Z","updated_at":"2022-03-03T01:12:41.881549Z","project":1}]
