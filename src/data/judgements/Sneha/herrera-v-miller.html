THE COURT:
 I will deliver my reasons now. I reserve the right to
amend these reasons for grammar and clarity, and to include full citations and
quotations. The result will not change as a consequence of any such amendments.

The plaintiff was involved in a motor vehicle accident on
November 2, 2017, in which he alleges that he suffered injuries, including
to the back, shoulder and neck and that he suffers from chronic pain,
headaches, sleeplessness and anxiety. The defendants now apply to have this
matter transferred to the Provincial Small Claims Court. The effect of the
transfer, if ordered, will be to limit the plaintiff’s claim in damages to
$35,000.
[3]
 

The governing statutory provision is s. 15 of the 
Supreme Court
Act, 
R.S.B.C. 1996, c. 443:
15 A judge or master may transfer proceedings to the
Provincial Court of British Columbia if
(a) the proceedings are within the
jurisdiction of the Provincial Court under the Small Claims Act,
(b) a party to the proceedings
applies to the judge or master, or all parties to the proceedings agree to the
transfer, and
(c) the judge or master considers it appropriate to do so.
[4]
 

Also relevant is Rule 14‑1 (10) of the 
Supreme Court Civil
Rules
, B.C. Reg 168/2009, which provides that if a plaintiff recovers an
amount in the Supreme Court that is within the monetary jurisdiction of the
Provincial Court, the plaintiff is not entitled to costs except disbursements,
unless the court finds that there was sufficient reason for bringing the matter
in the Supreme Court:
Costs in cases within small claims jurisdiction
(10) A plaintiff who recovers a
sum within the jurisdiction of the Provincial Court under the Small Claims Act
is not entitled to costs, other than disbursements, unless the court finds that
there was sufficient reason for bringing the proceeding in the Supreme Court
and so orders.
[5]
 

The appropriate test under s. 15 is two-fold: first, is the
proceeding sought to be transferred within the jurisdiction of the Provincial
Court?; and second, is transfer appropriate in the circumstances?: 
Cort v. Insurance
Corporation of British Columbia
, 2011 BCSC 586.
[6]
 

With respect to the first step in the test, the defendants submit that
this matter is within the jurisdiction of the Provincial Court as the damages
cannot be more than $35,000. They submit that the motor vehicle accident was
relatively minor, that the plaintiff suffered insignificant injuries for which
he received very little treatment, and that the injuries did not seriously
affect the plaintiff’s enjoyment of recreational and sporting activities, or
his employment. The defendants rely heavily upon the evidence of the plaintiff
given at his examination for discovery.
[7]
 

With respect to the second part of the test, there are a number of
factors that can be considered, including delay, the need for Supreme Court pre-trial
procedures, the availability of jury trials, and the complexity of the case.
[8]
 

The plaintiff submits that the pain suffered as a consequence of his
injuries is now chronic, that he attends massage therapy to manage his pain and
plans to have chiropractic treatments to further address his symptoms.
[9]
 

Both parties have referred me to case law relating to the assessment of
damages.
[10]
 

The defendant refers me to 
Sidor v. Coulter
, 2013 BCPC 0011, and
the cases cited therein in support of their submission that the plaintiff’s
damages in this matter will not exceed $35,000.
[11]
 

In contrast, the plaintiff refers me to several cases: 
Harry v. Powar
,
2018 BCSC 845, 
Poulin v. Armstrong
, 2019 BCSC 926 and 
Carson v. Ehman
,
2019 BCSC 2120 where they say the plaintiffs had similar injuries and were
awarded more than $35,000 in damages.
[12]
 

The plaintiff filed an affidavit sworn December 13, 2019. In that
affidavit, he deposes that, as a result of the accident, he continues to
experience symptoms in his back, shoulders and right hip, and has difficulty
sleeping. He complains of pain in his lower back and shoulders when not active,
and of pain lasting two to three days if he engages in activities. He further
deposed to having difficulty falling asleep and of waking in the night because
of lower back pain. He further deposed to attending massage therapy on a more
or less weekly basis and that he intends to seek chiropractic treatments.
[13]
 

In approaching this mater, I am particularly mindful of the caution
expressed by Justice McEwan in 
Kooner v. Singh
, 2011 BCSC 1384, at paras. 3
and 6. There, he stated it is only in the clearest of cases that a matter
should be transferred to the Provincial Court. It is only where there is no
possibility of a damage award exceeding the Small Claims’ limit that a matter
should be transferred to the Provincial Court:
[3] I have commented on other occasions about these
applications. They amount to the Supreme Court being asked to summarily
determine that damages could not possibly exceed $25,000 and also to accept
that a trial in Provincial Court is the most expeditious way to deal with the
action. On the basis of the material before me, it is not possible to say that
the case could not exceed $25,000. The plaintiff wishes to have the matter
heard in Supreme Court, and it would only be on the clearest basis that the
court would act to deprive a person who wished to be heard in the Supreme Court
of the right to do so.
…
[6] I have said as much on
the previous occasion of Chang v. Wren in oral reasons given June 10, 2011. I
see no reason to stray from the outcome in that case which was to the effect
that unless the court were persuaded that damages could not possibly exceed $25,000
the plaintiff should not be deprived of the opportunity to convince a court
that their damages exceed that amount. I considered it most unsafe to
summarily decide a case on the basis of descriptions that do not include the
actual evidence of the parties. Courts certainly have the experience of being
persuaded that cases that did not appear to be worth a great deal turn out to
be worth much more once they have been heard. I will also say, as I said in
Chang v. Wren, that I am absolutely not persuaded by any efficiency or
cost-saving argument, particularly where, as here, the application is brought
at a point post-discovery. There is very little process to avoid at this point
and, for the reasons I have already indicated, it is not at all clear that there
are cost savings to be realized.

The plaintiff is relatively young. He apparently had no medical issues
prior to the accident. He apparently suffered soft tissue injuries in the
accident to the neck, back and shoulders, and continues to suffer from what may
be chronic pain which may encumber him for the rest of his life. He also has
ongoing sleep difficulties and his injuries have affected his enjoyment of
recreational activities. The injuries suffered by the plaintiff and the effects
of those injuries are somewhat similar to what is described in 
Poulin

and 
Carson
, where the plaintiffs were awarded general damages of
considerably in excess of $35,000.
[15]
 

In my view, on the basis of the evidence before me and the authorities,
there is a possibility that the plaintiff may recover damages at trial in
excess of $35,000. Accordingly, this matter should not be transferred to the
Provincial Court, and the application is dismissed.
[16]
 

Costs, counsel?
[17]
 

MS. SEWELL: We would seek costs in any event, My Lord.
[18]
 

MS. CAREY: And our submission is costs in the cause, Your Honour. Or
any such thing as you see fit.
[19]
 

THE COURT: Costs of this application shall be to the plaintiff.
[20]
 

MS. SEWELL: Can the costs be fixed, or should we deal with that
later on?
[21]
 

THE COURT: You can deal with that at the trial, depending on how
matters work out. I should make it clear that my costs order is, if the
plaintiff recovers more than $35,000 at trial, that the plaintiff will be
entitled to his costs of this application.
[22]
 

MS. SEWELL: Thank you, My Lord.
[23]
 

MS. CAREY: My Lord, if I may, can it be $35,000 at a settlement
perhaps, and not just at trial, in case the matter settles before trial.
[24]
 

THE COURT: No, you can deal with that in your settlement if you decide
to settle.
[25]
 

MS. CAREY: Thank you, My Lord.
