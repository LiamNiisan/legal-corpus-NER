John Virvilis is a self-made man. He has been an excellent provider for
his wife, Tassia Virvilis, and his children, Peter Virvilis, Helen Dais and
Dennis Virvilis. 
[2]
 

To distinguish various family members from one another, I will refer to
them by their first names. In doing so, I intend no disrespect.
[3]
 

Sadly, conflict within the Virvilis family has resulted in protracted
litigation. By way of written reasons for judgment released on March 21, 2018,
I made a number of orders requiring that Helen be bought out of various family
companies. My earlier reasons for judgment are indexed at 2018 BCSC 459. Though
Peter and Dennis have a significant interest in the outcome, the current
application relates only to a dispute between Helen on the one hand and John,
Virvilis Holdings Ltd. (“Virvilis Holdings”) and Broadway Towers Holdings Ltd.
(“Broadway Towers”) on the other. 
[4]
 

During the initial hearing of Helen’s petition in 2018, the parties adduced
extensive evidence about their family history as well as their ownership of
various corporate entities, their varied contributions to the acquisition and
operation of those entities, and the conflict that had resulted in
irreconcilable differences between Helen and other family members in the
operation of those entities. They did not provide any evidence regarding the
value of their shareholdings.
[5]
 

On the evidence before me, I found that it was just and equitable to
dissolve and liquidate the companies under s. 324(1)(b) of the 
Business
Corporations Act
, S.B.C. 2002, c. 57 [
BCA
]. Having made that
finding, all of the so-called “oppression remedies” under s. 227(3) of the 
BCA

were available to me. 
[6]
 

None of the parties wanted the family companies to be dissolved and liquidated.
Rather, they sought to have Helen removed by different means. With respect to
Broadway Towers, I concluded that it was most appropriate to make the following
orders:
…
4. Broadway Towers, or its nominee, is ordered to
purchase Helen’s shares in Broadway Towers at their fair market value
determined as of the date of this order by an independent business valuator who
is satisfactory to each of Helen and John discounted by 40%. The terms of
payment are to be determined by Helen and John.
5. In the event of disagreement between Helen and
John regarding the valuation of Broadway Towers or terms of payment, each has
leave to apply for directions.
…
[7]
 

Helen and John were able to agree on a business valuator, Greg
Williamson of Williamson Valuation and Litigation Support Ltd. They were unable
to agree on the appropriate method to determine the fair market value of
Helen’s shares in Broadway Towers or payment terms. They seek direction. 
[8]
 

Helen and John also ask that I address the costs of the previous
application. 
[9]
 

Helen seeks to have her shares in Broadway Towers valued using a market
value approach based on the highest and best use of the commercial property
owned by Broadway Towers with no additional minority or marketability discount
applied. Based on Mr. Williamson’s work and an application of the 40% discount
I ordered, this would result in Helen receiving $6,041,734 for her shares.
[10]
 

John seeks to have Helen’s shares valued at $2,000,000, which is all
that he says Broadway Towers can afford without unduly disrupting his and
Tassia’s retirement income from Broadway Towers. This amount is based roughly
on the value of Helen’s shares in Broadway Towers using an income approach
after applying the 40% discount I ordered, with no additional minority or
marketability discount applied. In the alternative, if a market value approach
is used, John submits that minority and marketability discounts ought to be
applied on top of the 40% discount I ordered.
[11]
 

Regarding costs, as half of the previous application related to Helen’s
dispute with her father and half related to her dispute with her brothers, she
seeks one-half of her costs against her father and Virvilis Holdings. She has
resolved the issue of costs in relation to her dispute with her brothers
directly with them. 
[12]
 

John submits that success was divided and that he and Helen should
therefore bear their own costs in relation to the previous application. He
notes that Helen withdrew her oppression and unfair prejudice claims against
him at the last minute and that she sought the fair market value of her shares
with no discount applied.
[13]
 

The relevant background is set out in some detail in my earlier reasons
for judgment. In these reasons, I will simply summarize the most salient
points.
[14]
 

John emigrated from Greece to Canada in 1954 with nothing more than his
work ethic and business acumen. He married Tassia in 1960. Peter was born in
1961, Helen in 1963 and Dennis in 1968. John is 91. Tassia is 81.
[15]
 

John has been very successful in business. Relatively soon after
arriving in Canada, he opened a restaurant in Vancouver. As a result of the
success of the restaurant, he incorporated a company which became Broadway
Towers. In the 1970s and 1980s, Broadway Towers owned a number of apartment
buildings. In the 1980s, Broadway Towers sold the last of these buildings and
purchased a retail centre, Lougheed Village, in Coquitlam.
[16]
 

In 2004, John and Tassia effected an “estate freeze” in connection with
Broadway Towers for estate planning purposes. As a result, on January 30, 2004,
John and Tassia’s shares in the company were sold to the company in exchange
for new Class D preferred non-voting redeemable shares. The Class D shares were
valued at $2,292,000, which reflected the value of Lougheed Village at that
time. John was issued 49 Class A voting shares and Tassia was issued one Class
A voting share. Each of Peter, Helen and Dennis were issued 100 Class B common
non-voting shares valued at $0.01 each.
[17]
 

In 2014, the preferred Class D voting shares of Broadway Towers were
transferred to Virvilis Holdings, a company which is controlled by John.
Currently, John is the sole director of Broadway Towers.
[18]
 

The parties focussed much of their submissions on what I had “obviously”
intended in my previous reasons for judgment. The trouble is that the parties
disagreed on what was so obvious about my reasons.
[19]
 

Given the focus of the parties’ submissions on my earlier reasons, I will
set out in full my critical conclusions regarding the appropriate remedy at
paras. 156-166:
The
Appropriate Remedy
[156] In considering the appropriate remedy as between
Helen and John, it bears repeating that determining a fit remedy is so
fact-dependant that little guidance can be taken from comparing one case to
another: 
Wilson
 at para. 56.
[157] In the circumstances of Helen’s claim against John
and Broadway Towers, there is no evidence concerning what would happen to the
shares of Peter, Helen and Dennis in the event of family discord and the
prospect of future deadlock. Because of the conflicting affidavit evidence, I am
not in a position to lay “blame” on any party for Helen’s departure. I am
determining the appropriate remedy in the context of irreconcilable family
differences, not in the context of any wrongdoing. I cannot treat this as a
case where Helen has been involuntarily ousted from Broadway Towers nor as a
case where she is departing voluntarily. I also cannot take into account the
stress experienced by John and Tassia any more than I can take into account how
Helen feels about her experiences within the family and Broadway Towers.
[158] There are, however, a number of factors which favour
an earlier valuation date and/or greater discount.
[159] For starters, right or wrong, Helen has had very
little to do with the success of Broadway Towers. Even on her evidence, Helen’s
contributions are dated and minimal in relation to her father’s contributions.
Further, Helen’s shares were issued as part of an estate freeze for estate
planning purposes. She could never have expected to extract any value for her
shares while her parents were alive.
[160] On the other hand, a number of factors favour a
current valuation date and/or no discount.
[161] Helen’s position with Broadway Towers has not
changed. She was not expected to make a contribution to Broadway Towers in
return for her shares. If not for the breakdown in family relationships, Helen
would, in time, have derived substantial benefit from her shares in Broadway
Towers, without any effort on her part whatsoever.
[162] After having considered all of the circumstances, I
consider the most appropriate and fair remedy to be that Broadway Towers or its
nominee repurchase Helen’s shares at their current fair market value discounted
by 40%.
[163] In my view, this valuation date and discount best
meets the reasonable expectations of the parties in a way which is fair and
least intrusive. Helen will still receive substantial value for her shares,
with the discount reflecting that she will receive that value much earlier than
she could reasonably have expected. At the same time, John will maintain
control of Broadway Towers and, given Helen’s willingness to receive payment
over time, there is no reason for me to think that Lougheed Village would have
to be sold or that John and Tassia’s retirement income stream significantly
impaired.
[164] I have chosen a current valuation date because I
expect that it will be easier and less expensive to complete than a historic
one. Had I determined that an earlier valuation date would have been
appropriate, I would have applied a lesser discount. In addition to ease of
determination, from the perspective of fairness, I should add that, if land
values had decreased rather than increased, I would have imposed the same
remedy.
[165] Accordingly, I order that Broadway Towers, or its
nominee, purchase Helen’s shares in Broadway Towers at their fair market value
determined as of the date of this order by an independent business valuator who
is satisfactory to each of Helen and John, discounted by 40%. The terms of
payment are to be determined by Helen and John, failing which they can apply
for directions.
[166] John raised an issue at
the hearing regarding the most appropriate valuation method but I received no
evidence on the alternatives. If Helen and John are unable to agree on the
valuation method, they can apply for directions.
[20]
 

Regrettably, imperfections in my reasons have caused the parties consternation.
More regrettably, they did not simply ask me to clarify my reasons at a much
earlier stage. 
[21]
 

At this point, the only intellectually honest thing I can do is to
provide the clarity that the parties could have and, with all due respect,
should have sought much sooner. I consider it completely inappropriate for me
to interpret my own reasons for judgment or to allow the parties to reargue
their cases. While I do not consider it appropriate to bolster my previous
reasons for judgment in any way, I do consider it necessary to add a few words
of explanation.
[22]
 

In rendering my decision, I was fully aware that Helen’s shareholdings
in Broadway Towers would be very difficult to sell on the open market for a
variety of reasons. They represented a minority shareholding within a closely
held family company. They would not offer a theoretical third party purchaser
control now or in the future. Further, they offered no dividend and would not
offer a dividend for an unknown period of time. The circle of theoretical third
party purchasers would be small and any theoretical sale would only be
completed if the value of the shares was discounted.
[23]
 

When I awarded Helen the fair market value of her shares in Broadway
Towers discounted by 40%, I intended for that to convey that I considered it
“fair” to determine the fair market value of Broadway Towers and then apply a
40% discount to Helen’s interest in Broadway Towers. I did not intend for any
minority and/or marketability discount to be applied in addition to the 40%
discount. Had I intended for any additional discount to be applied, I would
have said so.
[24]
 

Further, when I awarded fair market value discounted at 40%, I intended
for the fair market value of Broadway Towers to be determined based on what a
willing buyer would pay a willing seller for all of the shares in Broadway
Towers on the open market. I did not intend for the estimate of the fair market
value of Broadway Towers’ shares to be limited in any way by hypothetical
conditions, such as an assumption that the commercial property owned by
Broadway Towers would be subject to a non-existent restriction on development.
[25]
 

In this case, the income value approach to the valuation of Broadway
Towers’ shares does not reflect what I ordered. It is based on the assumption
that the commercial property owned by Broadway Towers does not have re-development
potential such that a theoretical third party purchaser would only be acquiring
the current stream of income generated by Broadway Towers into the future. This
is a false assumption. Broadway Towers does have re-development potential. A
willing seller would never sell Broadway Towers to a willing purchaser based on
the income value approach for $13,510,000 rather than on the highest and best
use of the commercial property owned by Broadway Towers for $32,415,000.
[1]
[26]
 

Even though John does not intend to re-develop the commercial property
owned by Broadway Towers, for these reasons, Broadway Towers or its nominee
must purchase Helen’s shares based on the market value approach employed by Mr.
Williamson discounted by 40%. According to Mr. Williamson’s report, after
making certain necessary and appropriate deductions from the market value of
Broadway Towers, the purchase price for Helen’s shares is $6,041,734.
[27]
 

In rendering my original decision, I was somewhat handicapped by the
extent of the evidence adduced by the parties. I endeavoured to be sensitive to
John’s desire that he not be forced to sell Broadway Towers and that his and
Tassia’s retirement income from Broadway Towers not be unduly limited. Given Helen’s
flexibility regarding payment terms, I had no reason to think my order would
produce either of these outcomes. I continue to have that view.
[28]
 

John has now adduced evidence regarding Broadway Towers’ income, how
much money he and Tassia require in their retirements and how much debt
Broadway Towers can carry without impairing his and Tassia’s retirement income.
This information was not helpful to me in clarifying my original order
regarding the valuation of Helen’s shares in Broadway Towers but is helpful to
me in setting out how Broadway Towers or its nominee can complete the purchase
of Helen’s shares.
[29]
 

Helen has very thoughtfully proposed that Broadway Towers or its nominee
pay her $2,000,000 on the closing of the purchase of her shares. Helen would
then have judgment against Broadway Towers for the balance of the purchase
price, namely $4,041,734, with interest on the outstanding amount at the
registrar’s rate for post-judgment interest. Helen would be free to register
her judgment against the title to property owned by Broadway Towers but
enforcement of her judgment would otherwise be stayed pending certain events.
[30]
 

Subject to some relatively minor tweaking, mostly regarding the lifting
of the stay, I will make the order sought by Helen.
[31]
 

In the previous application, John sought to defeat Helen’s claims in
relation to Broadway Towers in their entirety. He argued that her shares in
Broadway Towers had not been validly issued or, in the alternative, if they had
been validly issued that they were subject to a resulting trust in favour of
John and Tassia. I rejected these arguments which resulted in a judgment in
favour of Helen. While the remedy was only 60% of what Helen was seeking, she received
a very significant award. I consider her to have been the substantially
successful party.
[32]
 

Had Helen not advanced then abandoned oppression and unfair prejudice
claims, I would have awarded her one-half of her costs of the previous
application at Scale B. To recognize the time spent by John preparing for the
claims that were abandoned at the last minute, I consider it appropriate to
order John and Virvilis Holdings to pay her one-third of her costs of the
previous application at Scale B.
[33]
 

I make the following order:
1.
 
Helen’s
shares in Broadway Towers shall be purchased by Broadway Towers or its nominee
for $6,041,734, with $2,000,000 to be paid on closing and the remainder to be
paid over time.
2.
 
The
closing of the sale of Helen’s shares in Broadway Towers shall occur on or
before February 28, 2020, or such later date as agreed by the parties.
3.
 
Helen
shall transfer all of her shares in Broadway Towers on the closing date.
4.
 
Helen
shall have judgment against Broadway Towers for the balance of the purchase
price in the amount of $4,041,734 (the “Money Judgment”), with interest to be
paid on the outstanding amount of the Money Judgment on and after March 1, 2020
at the registrar’s rate for post-judgment interest that is in force from time
to time.
5.
 
On or
after March 1, 2020, Helen may register the Money Judgment against the title to
any real property owned by Broadway Towers.
6.
 
Subject to
paragraph 7 of this order, execution on the Money Judgment is otherwise stayed
until:
a.
 
The later
of the death of John or Tassia;
b.
 
Any change
in control of Broadway Towers; or
c.
 
Any re-development
of the property owned by Broadway Towers having a civic address of 403 North
Road, Coquitlam, British Columbia.
7.
 
On the
happening of any of the events set out in paragraph 6 of this order, Helen has
leave to apply to the court for an order lifting the stay of execution of the
Money Judgment.
8.
 
John and
Broadway Towers must notify Helen immediately of any planned change in control
of Broadway Towers or any planned re-development of the property owned by
Broadway Towers having a civic address of 403 North Road, Coquitlam, British
Columbia.
9.
 
John and
Virvilis Holdings shall, jointly and severally, pay Helen one-third of her
costs of the application heard by the court on January 8-11, 2018 at Scale B.
[34]
 

As the entirely successful party, Helen shall also have her costs of the
present application against John and Virvilis Holdings at Scale B.
[35]
 

I thank counsel for their assistance and wish the parties well.
