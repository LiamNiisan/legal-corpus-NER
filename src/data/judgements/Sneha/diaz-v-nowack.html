THE COURT:
 This is a damages‑only personal injury action arising
from a motor vehicle accident. Liability has been admitted by the defendants. The
trial was set for 10 days to commence on January 6, 2020. The plaintiff applies
for an order prohibiting the defendants from calling five witnesses, and to exclude
any new witnesses except by court order. The plaintiff argues that the proposed
witnesses were either not on a witness list by the ordered deadline, or their
"will say" statements were not provided by the order deadline. Counsel
attended a trial management conference (TMC) on November 29, 2019, at which
Justice Masuhara set a defence deadline for "will say" statements and
contact information for the witnesses of three weeks prior to the trial, being
December 16, 2019, and for an exchange of trial schedules of two weeks before
the trial, being December 23, 2019.
[2]
 

The plaintiff also applies to prohibit the defendants from tendering two
documents into evidence because they were not produced on any lists of
documents until the day before trial. There were no TMC orders respecting the
deadline for production of documents from the defendants. An order was made at
the TMC that the plaintiff's updated list of documents must be provided two
weeks before the trial; there was no similar order made pertaining to the
defendants.
[3]
 

The defendants ultimately provided a witness list on December 16,
followed by updates to the list and evolving “will say” statements. The
proposed defence witnesses at issue are as follows: 
1)
 
Derek Gulkison,
the former spouse of the plaintiff and father to their child. He was on a witness
list provided on December 16, 2019, but his "will say" statement was
provided on December 30, 2019, and then expanded on January 2, 2020.
2)
 
Judith Pinto, a
director of human resources at a former employer for the plaintiff. She was on
a witness list of December 23, 2019, with a "will say"
statement provided on December 30, 2019.
3)
 
Allison Spicer, the
head of human resources of an employer where the plaintiff worked after the
accident. She was on a witness list of December 23, 2019, but no
"will say" statement has been provided. 
4)
 
Verna Ursula was
on a witness list of December 16, 2019, but no "will say" statement has
been provided. The defendants no longer intend to call Ms. Ursula as a witness.
5)
 
Barry Wells, the
CEO of an employer. He was on the defendants’ December 16, 2019 witness list,
and his "will say" statement was provided on January 2, 2020.
[4]
 

The defendants plan to call these witnesses mainly as rebuttal witnesses
depending on the plaintiff's direct testimony. The two documents in question
consist of a Provincial Court order dated December 14, 2017, respecting
parenting arrangements in the plaintiff's family law case and a document titled
"places mom and Parker have slept and/or lived." Both were produced on
the day before trial, 
i.e.
, on Sunday, January 5, 2020, at 2:40 p.m.
The defence counsel's communications noted that she only received the new
documents the day prior, that being Saturday, January 4, 2020.
[5]
 

The plaintiff has provided three cases in support of her argument that I
should not exercise my discretion to belatedly admit the evidence: 
Owens v.
Steveston Waterfront Properties Inc.
, 2019 BCSC 747; 
Tompkins v. Bruce 
(14
December 2011), Vancouver M070137 (B.C.S.C.); and 
Stone v. Ellerman
,
2009 BCCA 294 at paras. 30–31. The defendants rely on 
Devathasan v.
Devathasan
, 2019 BCSC 1559; 
Davies v. Canada Shineray Suppliers Group
Inc.
, 2017 BCSC 304; 
Fu v. Zhu
, 2017 BCSC 749; and 
Houston v.
Kine
, 2011 BCCA 358. Each of these cases sets out some basic factors the
court might consider in exercising this discretionary power. These factors include
whether: 
1)
 
there is prejudice
to the other party;
2)
 
there is a reasonable
explanation for the delay; 
3)
 
the evidence is needed
for a determination on the merits; and 
4)
 
the ends of
justice require the evidence.
[6]
 

The defendants oppose the exclusion of the witnesses and documents on
the basis that:
1)
 
there will be
serious prejudice since the plaintiff's evidence will be largely unchallenged because
these are all the defendants’ lay witnesses;
2)
 
the delay was
caused because the instructing client did not authorize work to mobilize
witnesses until close to the commencement of the trial and only after mediation
was unsuccessful;
3)
 
the defence
evidence is required for a determination on the merits, if the plaintiff’s
testimony is contrary to the information gathered; and 
4)
 
the ends of
justice require a determination on the merits with all available evidence.
[7]
 

The plaintiff argues that the instructing defence policy should not be
at her expense. The plaintiff is prejudiced if the trial proceeds with the last-minute
inclusion of these witnesses because counsel will not have the chance to
prepare, including searching for other witnesses that may contradict the
defence witnesses. The plaintiff seeks an adjournment of the trial if the court
will not grant the order to exclude the witnesses and documents.
[8]
 

For the reasons that follow, I adjourn the trial with costs thrown away
payable forthwith to the plaintiff:
1)
 
I am concerned
that excluding the evidence might prevent the determination of the issues on
the merits. Given the submissions, I anticipate the potential for serious
conflicts in the evidence and for challenges to the plaintiff's credibility. Without
the ability to rely on evidence from other witnesses and to use the said documents,
there is a real risk the court will be hampered in its ability to determine the
issues.
2)
 
The proposed
evidence may be important to the fact‑finding process. 
3)
 
I accept the
plaintiff's argument that she will be prejudiced if the witnesses are allowed
to testify at this time because she will not have time to adequately prepare. 
4)
 
The plaintiff is
prejudiced by an adjournment as well, however, due to the time wasted in
preparing for a second trial and by being delayed in an adjudication of her
case. For this reason, I am awarding her costs thrown away, payable forthwith.
5)
 
The defendants
chose only to commence witness preparation at the last minute, only days before
the TMC order deadline. This is a practice that deserves sanction and rebuke. Trial
management conferences, the orders made there, and the deadlines set out in the

Supreme Court Civil Rules
 are all designed to provide parties with time
to prepare and to consider the strengths and weaknesses of their case, so a
trial can proceed in an efficient manner.
