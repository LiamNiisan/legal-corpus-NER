Reedman   Linda Paul, Licensed Insolvency Trustee, appearing on  her own behalf, via teleconference: L. Paul   Appearing on his own behalf, via teleconference: L. Hanlon   Place and Date of Hearing: Vancouver, B.C. November 26, 2020 Place and Date of Judgment: Vancouver, B.C. January 12, 2021   [1]     Jolene Karen Johnson is a creditor in the Estate of the Bankrupt Lee  Hanlon and applies for an order pursuant to s. 163(2) of the  Bankruptcy and  Insolvency Act , R.S.C. 1985, c. B-3 (the “ BIA ”) that Mr. Hanlon and  Gwen Woods, his mother, be examined under oath and any discharge hearing be  held after these examinations have been completed. In addition, Ms. Johnson  seeks an order pursuant to the same section that documents be produced. [2]     The notice of application filed September 4, 2020, also sought an order  to allow Ms. Johnson to commence and prosecute a proceeding against Mr.  Hanlon’s former employer. This aspect of the application was adjourned  generally.  [3]     Ms. Johnson obtained a judgment against Mr. Hanlon after a five day  defamation trial that took place in August 2018. On April 23, 2019, Justice  Dardi issued her reasons, indexed at 2019 BCSC 622. Ms. Johnson is referred to  as Dianna Holden in those reasons. She changed her name from Dianna Holden to  Jolene Johnson after starting that litigation. Ms. Johnson was awarded damages  in the amount of $27,500 against Mr. Hanlon. A co-defendant was made jointly  liable for $1,000. Ms. Johnson was also granted a permanent injunction against  the defendants prohibiting them from publishing defamatory statements  respecting her. On August 30, 2019, she was awarded special costs which have  not yet been assessed.  [4]     On June 14, 2019, Mr. Hanlon filed a proposal under s. 62 of the  BIA.   [5]     At a meeting of creditors held on July 30, 2019, Cody G. Reedman,  Ms. Johnson’s counsel, was appointed as inspector of the estate. At this meeting,  Mr. Hanlon advised, which is recorded in the Minutes, that “there was an  expectation that any amounts owing to his mother would be deducted from his  inheritance.”  [6]     On August 13, 2019, Ms. Johnson filed a Notice of Intended Opposition to  Mr. Hanlon’s discharge.  [7]     On February 3, 2020, Ms. Johnson filed an amended proof of claim. In it  she made an unsecured claim for $94,443.01, consisting of the original judgment  amount, post-judgment interest, and a claim of $66,788.26 for special costs.  [8]     On February 26, 2020 Mr. Hanlon was examined under oath by Brian Chau,  Official Receiver.  [9]     Ms. Johnson has made a number of requests for information and documents  which she claims have not been answered.  [10]     Ms. Johnson argues that Mr. Hanlon should be subjected to an examination  so that she can canvass issues relating to: ·     If he is a beneficiary under his mother’s will and the potential  of an inheritance being received; ·     Information respecting Mr. Hanlon’s bank accounts and credit  cards, including his use of his mother’s credit card; ·     Monies and loans Mr. Hanlon may have received from his parents; ·     How Mr. Hanlon is paying for expenses; and ·     Particulars relating to the companies Mr. Hanlon operates, the  income he earns, and whether he has been intentionally underemployed. [11]     She argues that an examination of Mr. Hanlon is necessary since the  evidence produced to date supports that “something is amiss” and there is “a disconnect”  respecting Mr. Hanlon’s financial circumstances.  [12]     Ms. Johnson seeks to examine Ms. Woods respecting the financial  circumstances between her and Mr. Hanlon and any arrangements concerning the  will, inheritance, and financial documentation. She argues that Ms. Woods is  directly connected to the bankrupt estate. [13]     Ms. Johnson seeks the production of documents from Mr. Hanlon and  Ms. Woods consisting of all books, documents, correspondence or papers  relating in all or in part to the Bankrupt or the estate of the Bankrupt,  including the wrongful dismissal action, details of any inheritance from Ms.  Woods to the Bankrupt, and financial records concerning the Bankrupt’s use of  Ms. Woods’ bank accounts and credit cards.  [14]     Mr. Hanlon submits that his mother and stepfather are still alive. If  his mother dies everything will go to her husband. They have been married for  40 years and the house is in joint tenancy. He advised that his mother is  currently 85 years old, she has mobility issues, and is deaf in both ears. His  stepfather is either 72 or 73 years old. He opposes the examination of his  mother as being in the nature of a fishing expedition. [15]     He disputes that there is anything amiss in respect to the documents  provided. He explains the reason there is a senior’s discount reference on the  bank accounts is because it is a joint account with his stepfather who is a  senior. He explained that the only time he has used his mother’s credit card  was to pay a process server who required a credit card over the phone. He  denies ever accessing his mother’s bank account. [16]     He submits that he has provided an explanation of his work history,  including what companies he worked for. He submits that the applications be  dismissed as they are without merit, a fishing expedition, and made in order to  delay the discharge hearing.  [17]     Ms. Paul advised that she was taking no position in the application but  did make the following submissions. [18]     She advised the Court that an examination of Mr. Hanlon under oath had taken  place. Mr. Hanlon has been extremely forthcoming with everything that he has  been asked. To her knowledge there are no outstanding requests. It would be an  unusual request to demand the production of a will from someone who is still  living. If Mr. Hanlon’s mother passes away then Ms. Paul will take all  necessary steps to investigate. Finally, she is of the view that the  application to discharge should proceed. The discharge hearing has been  delayed. [19]     Section 163(2) of the  BIA  provides: (2) On the  application to the court by the Superintendent, any creditor or other  interested person and on sufficient cause being shown, an order may be made for  the examination under oath, before the registrar or other authorized person, of  the trustee, the bankrupt, an inspector or a creditor, or any other person  named in the order, for the purpose of investigating the administration of the  estate of any bankrupt, and the court may further order any person liable to be  so examined to produce any books, documents, correspondence or papers in the  person’s possession or power relating in all or in part to the bankrupt, the  trustee or any creditor, the costs of the examination and investigation to be  in the discretion of the court. [20]     Justice Voith, as he then was, in  Branconnier (Re) , 2017 BCSC  1896, sets out a list of the applicable principles at para. 70: i)   the  onus is on an applicant to demonstrate that there is sufficient cause to  justify the examination being sought:  Ellis (Re ), 2013 SKQB 225 at para.  4; ii)   the  examination must be for the general benefit of creditors and it must relate to  the general administration of the bankrupt’s estate:  Assaf (Re)  (1976),  23 C.B.R. (N.S.) 14 (Ont. SCJ) at para. 6; iii)   as  a necessary corollary to the foregoing principle a creditor cannot seek to  conduct an examination for a collateral purpose or for reasons connected with  other litigation:  Assaf  at para. 5 and  Thomson Kernaghan & Co.  (Re)  [2003] O.J. No. 5300 at para. 9; iv)   the  person to be examined is someone who has a factual connection to the bankrupt’s  estate or to estate issues and is someone who may shed light on those issues:  Ellis   at para. 6;  v)   the  bar for showing or establishing “sufficient cause” is low:  Ellis  at  para. 7,  Kane (Re) , 2011 NBQB 142 at para. 26 and  Josipovicz (Re) ,  2012 ONSC 5361 at para. 14; In  Black v. Ernst & Young Inc.  (1997), 47 C.B.R.  (3d) 129 the Nova Scotia Court of Appeal stated that orders for examination  under s. 163(2) “usually issue as a matter of course”: at para. 20.  Respectfully, this may set the required standard too low. It is clear that the  applicant must provide some evidence in support of its application and that the  court must be satisfied that the application is neither frivolous or oppressive  or in the nature of a fishing expedition:  NsC Diesel Power Inc. (Re)  [1998]  N.S.J. No. 303 (N.S.C.A.) at para. 17 and  Ellis  at para. 6. In  Josipovicz  the court said that a creditor is  required to file evidence that demonstrates that the person sought to be  examined likely possesses information “which may shed some light on the estate  or its administration”: at para. 17. Some cases have suggested that the evidence adduced must  establish or show “something being amiss” and that the named party has the  ability to shed light on that matter. In  Josipovicz , however, Brown J.  said: [ 15 ]   Although some of the cases have suggested that an order should not be granted  under section 163(2) unless the creditor demonstrated that something was  “amiss”, that word risks deflecting the focus of the judicial inquiry on such a  motion. Certainly, if something is “amiss”, further investigation may be  merited. But, equally, an investigation may be appropriate where an  examination is required to reconcile, or shed further light on, conflicting  information gathered by the trustee. In such a case nothing may be  “amiss”, but an inquiry is needed. So, where an order is sought under  section 163(2) against a third party – i.e. neither the bankrupt nor the  trustee – the focus should be on whether the examination likely will secure  information required by the trustee to continue with or complete the  administration of the estate of the bankrupt. vi)   The  scope of the eventual examination is “quite wide but not infinite”:  McDonough  (Re) , 27 C.B.R. (4th) 279 at para. 7 and  McDonald (Re) , 2014 BCSC  2076 at para. 26. [21]     The central question is whether Ms. Johnson has shown “sufficient” cause  to support the order she seeks.  [22]     I accept that there have been issues raised that need some clarification.  Mr. Hanlon initially did not claim in his Statement of Affairs that he  owed any money to his mother and stepfather. He claims he was not aware that  family debts were to be included in his bankruptcy. The circumstances of those  loans and what arrangements, if any, for how they will be repaid is a matter  that merits further investigation.  [23]     It is not entirely clear to what extent there has been some  intermingling of the financial affairs of Mr. Hanlon and his mother but the  evidence does support that he has used her credit card. He says it was only for  a limited purpose but the applicant is entitled to explore this issue further. Mr.  Hanlon admits that his mother provides him with money to pay certain expenses.  He is living with his mother and stepfather in a self-contained bachelor suite.  He is not paying rent.  [24]      The particulars of his income and employment are also unclear. At the  trial, Mr. Hanlon gave sworn evidence he was employed by a Mr. Sadilla of ASIS  Protection, which should reference Mr. Cedilla of ACES Protection, starting in  June, 2017. However, according to a Record of Employment dated May 6, 2019,  Mr. Cedilla indicates that the first day that Mr. Hanlon worked was May  11, 2018. An examination should shed further light on this inconsistency as  well as the allegation made that he is intentionally underemployed. [25]     I am convinced that sufficient cause has been shown by Ms. Johnson to support  an examination of Mr. Hanlon under s. 163(2) of the  BIA.  I am satisfied  that such an examination has the prospect of benefitting the general body of  creditors and it is not a fishing expedition. Accordingly, I order that Mr.  Hanlon attend at an examination at a time and place to be fixed. The  examination will be limited to two hours. The costs of examination and  obtaining a transcript will be borne by Ms. Johnson.  [26]     I am further satisfied that an order should be made that any discharge  hearing take place after the examination of Mr. Hanlon has been completed. In  order that there is no delay I direct that the examination is to be completed  prior to February 28, 2021. Mr. Hanlon is to cooperate in setting a date for  the examination within this time period. The discharge hearing can be scheduled  for a date after the end of February 2021.  [27]     The applicant seeks a broad order for production of documents in the  draft order that was sought. In my view a more productive approach is to have  Ms. Johnson specifically set out the additional documents she is seeking  by way of a letter to Mr. Hanlon, with a copy to the Trustee.  [28]     This letter setting out the particulars of the documents should be  provided at least three weeks before the examination takes place. Mr. Hanlon  will produce the documents he has in his possession or control no later than  seven days prior to the day scheduled for his examination.  [29]     Ms. Johnson seeks the production of Ms. Woods’ will in an attempt to  show that Mr. Hanlon is a beneficiary under it. I assume that she does so in  order to then argue that his potential inheritance should be considered during  the discharge hearing. In the decision of  Eng (Re) , 2014 BCSC 525, Master  Muir, sitting as a Registrar, referenced the  Re Baker  (1987), 63 C.B.R.  (N.S.) 21 decision on the relevance of a potential inheritance. Mr. Justice  Potts states in  Re Baker : 2. In  Re  Stafford   (1959), 37 C.B.R. 206  (Ont.), Smily J. stated at p. 208: I think I may say it is not the  policy of the court, in considering the application of a bankrupt for his  discharge, to take into account the possibility of his inheriting a legacy or  some assets from a relative in the future where that time, in the ordinary  course of events, is not likely to be in the immediate or near future, but  rather, having regard to the usual expectation of life, is probably some  distance from the time of the administration of the bankrupt estate and where  there may never be such inheritance. 3. I agree  with the reasons of Smily, J. Indeed, I would go further. No consideration  should be given to that possibility unless it is a real probability in the  sense that the bankrupt can almost be assured of receiving monies from the  estate of her parents. 4.   In my view there is no reason, in this day and age, why parents or relatives  should, in effect, be held responsible for the debts of their children. [30]     I am not convinced that the production of Ms. Woods’ will should establish  that Mr. Hanlon will be receiving any inheritance. Even if Mr. Hanlon is a  beneficiary under his mother’s will, she is currently alive, and there is no  evidence that he will inherit in the immediate or near future. The evidence  before me establishes that Ms. Woods is married and that some, if not most,  of her assets are owned in joint tenancy with her current husband. Mr. Hanlon  advised that his stepfather is more than ten years younger than his mother. This  does not restrict Ms. Johnson from exploring issues relating to any potential  inheritance at the examination of Mr. Hanlon. [31]     It will be up to the presider of the discharge hearing to ultimately  decide what consideration should be given on any potential inheritance when  determining the conditions of Mr. Hanlon’s discharge.  [32]     I am not satisfied that Ms. Woods should be required to attend an  examination. In my view such an examination would be oppressive in light of  Ms. Woods’ age, being 85 years old, her current health status, and the  current COVID-19 pandemic. I further note in the affidavit of service of  Matthew Gelies, sworn September 17, 2020, he deposes that when he served the  application materials on Ms. Woods she “did not appear to understand that she  was being served legal documents.” Any questions about the use of her credit  cards by Mr. Hanlon or how Mr. Hanlon is paying for his living expenses  can be canvassed at the examination of Mr. Hanlon. Ms. Johnson’s application to  examine Ms. Woods is dismissed.  [33]     Ms. Johnson is entitled to her costs of this application from Mr.  Hanlon.  “Forth  J.”"},"meta":{},"created_at":"2022-03-08T08:08:14.440486Z","updated_at":"2022-03-10T01:11:08.469657Z","project":2},{"id":44,"annotations":[{"id":50,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"start":0,"end":36,"text":"COURT OF APPEAL FOR BRITISH COLUMBIA","labels":["COURT_NAME"]},"id":"3e221094-9","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":152,"end":158,"text":"K.G.T.","labels":["PERS_RESPONDENT"]},"id":"3e22112a-9","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":191,"end":227,"text":"The Honourable Mr. Justice Groberman","labels":["PERS_JUDGE"]},"id":"3e22115c-9","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":228,"end":261,"text":"The Honourable Mr. Justice Hunter","labels":["PERS_JUDGE"]},"id":"3e221184-9","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":263,"end":298,"text":"he Honourable Madam Justice Griffin","labels":["PERS_JUDGE"]},"id":"3e2211b6-9","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":339,"end":379,"text":"the Court of Appeal for British Columbia","labels":["COURT_NAME"]},"id":"3e221206-9","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":535,"end":541,"text":"K.F.M.","labels":["PERS_APPELLANT"]},"id":"3e221238-9","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":570,"end":580,"text":"M.G.

K.G.T. , 2019 BCCA 339,   Vancouver Docket CA46217).  Oral Reasons for Judgment The Appellant, appearing in person: K.F.M. Counsel for the Respondent: M.G. Perry Place and Date of Hearing: Vancouver, British   Columbia January 6, 2020 Place and Date of Judgment: Vancouver, British   Columbia January 6, 2020   Summary: The appellant seeks a review  of a decision denying him leave to appeal an interim order under the Family Law  Act conferring sole authority on the respondent to make health-related  decisions concerning their son pending trial. Held: Application dismissed. The  leave judge did not commit an error of law or principle and did not  misapprehend the evidence. [1]     HUNTER J.A. : On July 5, 2019, an order was made in the Supreme  Court of British Columbia that granted the respondent, K.G.T., the sole  authority on an interim basis to make decisions related to the health of the  parties’ eight-year-old child. The order was made in the context of high  conflict family litigation between the parties, who separated in October 2011  and have been engaged in disputes over the parental responsibilities for their  child for much of the intervening eight years. The trial of this longstanding  litigation is now scheduled for July of 2020. [2]     Although the transcript of the chambers judge’s reasons refers to  s. 45(f) of the  Family Law Act , S.B.C. 2011, c. 25, it is  apparent that the order was made by reference to s. 41(f) of that  Act . [3]     The child resides with his mother, K.G.T. His father, K.F.M., has  parenting time of eight hours per week in accordance with interim orders made  and varied throughout the eight years of litigation. For clarity in these  reasons, I will refer to the applicant K.F.M. as the Father, and the respondent  K.G.T. as the Mother. [4]     The basis of the July 5 order was a concern that the parties’ child  required psychological counselling but the Father was refusing to consent to  the referral to a child psychiatrist recommended by the child’s general  practitioner. A physician had been retained to prepare a s. 211 Child  Custody, Parenting Capacity and Parenting Time report, but it was not anticipated  that the report would be completed until a few months before trial. The Supreme  Court chambers judge who heard the Mother’s application considered the Father’s  reasons for not consenting to counselling and other mental health  recommendations to have no merit. The effect of the order was that pending  trial, the Mother would make all decisions concerning the child’s physical and  health treatments. [5]     The Father wishes to appeal this July 5 order. Because the July 5 order  grants interim relief under the  Family Law Act , leave to appeal is  required. The Father sought leave to appeal before a judge of this Court in  chambers, but his application was dismissed for reasons indexed at 2019 BCCA  339. He seeks a review of that decision by a division of this Court pursuant to  s. 9(6) of the  Court of Appeal Act , R.S.B.C. 1996, c. 77. [6]     At the outset, it is important to note that a review of a  decision of a chambers judge is not a re-hearing of the application. The  standard to be applied by a division of this Court on a review application was  summarized by Madam Justice Dickson in  Lungu v. British Columbia (Human  Rights Tribunal) ,  2016  BCCA 136 ,  in these terms: [8] A review  application brought before a division of the court under s. 9(6) of the  Act   does not provide an opportunity for a rehearing of the original chambers  application. The standard of review is whether the justice sitting in chambers  was wrong in law, wrong in principle, or misconceived the facts. In the absence  of such an error, the court will not interfere with the chambers judge’s  exercise of discretion:  DeFehr v. DeFehr,   2002  BCCA 139  at para.  6 . [7]     Thus, the question for this Court is whether in exercising his  discretion not to grant leave to appeal, the chambers judge was wrong in law,  wrong in principle, or misconceived the facts. [8]     With this standard in mind, I turn to the decision of the chambers  judge, who for clarity I will refer to as the leave judge. The leave judge  began by reviewing the circumstances in which the order had been made. A series  of applications was before the Supreme Court chambers judge on July 5. The  Father had sought an order varying the interim parenting time order to increase  his parenting time and to entitle him to travel with the child in the summer. The  chambers judge was not prepared to change the parenting time order. That part  of the July 5 order is not in issue in this Court. [9]     In addition, the Mother sought a series of orders relating to the  allocation of parental responsibilities. The Father objected to those  applications being heard on July 5 due to insufficient notice, and the chambers  judge gave effect to this objection in respect of all of the Mother’s  applications except the application concerning the child’s health-related  treatments. The chambers judge explained his reasoning for proceeding with that  application in these terms: [6] Having read and  considered the materials before me, in the circumstances I am satisfied that  there is some urgency to the respondent’s application, but only as it relates  to the child’s health-related treatment and, accordingly, I am allowing the  respondent to bring her application in that regard by way of short notice. The  balance of the respondent’s application will have to be heard on a later date  convenient to the parties and Madam Justice Fleming, who is the case management  judge assigned to this matter and who is familiar with these proceedings. [10]     The leave judge then reviewed the chambers judge’s assessment of the  evidence. He summarized the chambers judge’s assessment in this way: [11] The chambers judge expressed serious concern about  the child’s mental health. He understood that [the Father] was convinced that  the situation is one involving parental alienation by [the Mother]. Given that Dr. England  had been retained to assess the entire situation and prepare a full s. 211  parenting assessment, the judge considered that no change in parenting time  should be ordered until that assessment had been completed. Accordingly, he  dismissed [the Father’s] application. [12] The chambers judge  found no merit in [the Father’s] reasons for not consenting to counselling and  other recommended mental health modalities. Given this, and the judge’s  concerns about the child’s mental health, he granted the order sought by [the  Mother]. [11]     The leave judge then turned to the law relating to leave to appeal, and  cited the test in this way: [ 13 ] The party seeking  leave to appeal bears the burden of showing that leave should be granted:  British  Columbia Teachers’ Federation v. British Columbia (Attorney General)   (1986),  4 B.C.L.R. (2d) 8  at 11 (C.A.) (in Chambers) . The criteria to be  applied are well-established: (1) whether the  point on appeal is of significance to the practice; (2) whether the  point raised is of significance to the action itself; (3) whether the  appeal is  prima facie  meritorious or, on the  other hand, whether it is frivolous; and (4) whether the  appeal will unduly hinder the progress of the action. See also  Goldman,  Sachs & Co. v. Sessions,   2000  BCCA 326  at para.  10  (Saunders J.A. in Chambers) . The overarching concern is the interests of justice and the four  criteria are “all considered under the rubric of the interests of justice”:  Movassaghi  v. Aghtai,   2010  BCCA 175  at para.  22  (D. Smith J.A. in Chambers)  and the cases cited therein. [12]     This test is well accepted in this Court, and I can see no error in the  leave judge’s statement of the applicable law. [13]     The leave judge went on to point out the high hurdle faced by appellants  who seek appeals of interim orders in family matters: [ 16 ] The  court’s jurisdiction to vary interim orders made in family matters is  “extremely limited”, and it will only interfere with such orders “in  exceptional circumstances”:  N. (T.) v. N. (J.C.),   2013 BCCA 432  at para.  10  (Levine J.A. in Chambers);  F. (J.G.) v. B. (C.L.),   2003 BCCA 382  at para.  10  (Huddart J.A. in Chambers). [14]     This principle is also well accepted in this Court. [15]     The leave judge then considered the grounds for appeal, which comprise  35 numbered paragraphs in the amended notice of application for leave to  appeal, but which the leave judge summarized in this way (para. 20): a) whether the chambers judge erred in  allowing [the Mother’s] application to proceed on short leave, despite her  non-compliance with the service requirements in the  Supreme Court  Family Rules  and despite the informal protocol  established by the case management judge; and b) whether  the chambers judge misapprehended the evidence and erred in his assessment of  urgency. [16]     The leave judge reviewed the submissions of the Father and concluded  that he had not identified a good arguable case of sufficient merit to warrant  scrutiny by a division of this Court. The Father submits that the judgment  refusing leave contains factual inaccuracies and does not give effect to what  he characterizes as the breach of his procedural rights in hearing the Mother’s  application on short notice. The alleged breach of procedural rights concerns  the decision of the chambers judge to hear and decide the application  concerning the child’s health needs, without the Mother having given proper  notice under the Rules. The leave judge considered that the procedural issue  was not one that satisfied the requirement of a point of significance to the  practice or the parties. I would go further. In my view, there is no reasonable  prospect that a division of this Court would interfere with the exercise of a  chambers judge’s discretion to hear this application on short notice given the  material that was before the judge. [17]     The applicant has put a number of authorities before us in support of  his review application, but I consider it necessary to address only one,  Williamson  v. Williamson , 2016 BCCA 87.  Williamson  was one of those rare cases  where this Court did interfere with an interim order relating to family  litigation, but the circumstances were very different. The mother in that case  had sought an order for inpatient counselling for the children of the marriage,  but the application had been dismissed by a judge of the Supreme Court. The  mother then brought an identical application before a different judge, who  granted the order, apparently on the mistaken belief that the first judge had  not made a decision on the first application. This Court held that the second  judge had erred in hearing the mother’s application without first finding there  was a material change in circumstances from those prevailing at the time the first  application was dismissed.  Williamson  did not involve an emergent  situation of mental health needs of the child requiring an interim order to  break an impasse between the parents. [18]     In the case at bar, the chambers judge was of the view that there was  urgency in addressing the child’s mental health needs. Although the Father  disputes that assessment, there was ample evidence before the chambers judge to  justify this conclusion. There is no reasonable possibility that a division of  this Court would interfere with that determination. [19]     In my view, the refusal of leave to appeal was an appropriate exercise  of the leave judge’s discretion, and I can see no error that would justify  interfering with the order. Accordingly, I would dismiss the application to discharge  or vary the order refusing leave to appeal. [20]     The leave judge also dismissed a second application brought by the  Father for an order that he be permitted to file materials without paying court  fees, generally referred to as a no fees order, as he did not consider that the  position being argued by the Father had merit, which is a prerequisite to a no  fees order. For the reasons I have outlined in relation to the leave  application, I can see no error in that decision. [21]     As a result, I would dismiss the application to discharge or vary the  order refusing leave to appeal and refusing a no fees order. Costs of this  application are payable to the respondent. [22]     GROBERMAN J.A. : I agree. [23]     GRIFFIN J.A. : I agree. [24]     GROBERMAN J.A. : The application to discharge or vary the order is  dismissed. “The  Honourable Mr. Justice Hunter”"},"meta":{},"created_at":"2022-03-08T08:08:14.440100Z","updated_at":"2022-03-10T01:09:10.065675Z","project":2},{"id":45,"annotations":[{"id":51,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"start":3,"end":40,"text":"THE SUPREME COURT OF BRITISH COLUMBIA","labels":["COURT_NAME"]},"id":"3e220018-9","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":145,"end":158,"text":"Pareen Jiwani","labels":["PERS_APPELLANT"]},"id":"3e2200ae-9","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":172,"end":184,"text":"Nawaz Jiwani","labels":["PERS_RESPONDENT"]},"id":"3e2200ea-9","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":201,"end":238,"text":"Nick Jiwani Baseline  Development Ltd","labels":["PERS_RESPONDENT"]},"id":"3e220130-9","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":260,"end":290,"text":"The Honourable Justice Fleming","labels":["PERS_JUDGE"]},"id":"3e220180-9","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":9795,"end":9808,"text":"Madam Justice","labels":["PERS_JUDGE"]},"id":"3e2201b2-9","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":10084,"end":10097,"text":"Madam Justice","labels":["PERS_JUDGE"]},"id":"3e2201e4-9","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":10364,"end":10377,"text":"Madam Justice","labels":["PERS_JUDGE"]},"id":"3e220216-9","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":10380,"end":10391,"text":"Fleming  J.","labels":["PERS_JUDGE"]},"id":"3e220248-9","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":639,"end":648,"text":"THE COURT","labels":["COURT_NAME"]},"id":"3e220270-9","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":8013,"end":8033,"text":"the Court of Appeal ","labels":["COURT_NAME"]},"id":"3e2202a2-9","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":390,"end":401,"text":"P.J.

Jiwani,   2022 BCSC 95 Date: 20220107 Docket: E150451 Registry:  Vancouver Between: Pareen Jiwani Claimant And Nawaz Jiwani, also  known as Nick Jiwani Baseline  Development Ltd. Respondent Before:  The Honourable Justice Fleming Oral Reasons for Judgment   (In  Chambers) Counsel for the Claimant  appearing via teleconference: P.J. Reimer Counsel for the Respondents appearing via teleconference: J.R. Bienvenu R.A. Hira, Articled   Student Place and Date of Trial\/Hearing: Vancouver, B.C. January 7, 2022 Place and Date of Judgment: Vancouver, B.C. January 7, 2022   [1]     THE COURT:  I wish to make the parties aware that if a transcript  of these reasons is ordered, I will edit them to perhaps clarify my meaning and  add case citations etc.  [2]     The respondent, Nawaz Jiwani, applies for an order disqualifying the  claimant, Pareen Jiwani's counsel, Paul Reimer from continuing to represent her  in this family law proceeding. Mr. Reimer also acts for Ms. Jiwani in  a related civil proceeding brought against Mr. Jiwani and several others,  which Mr. Reimer submits ought to be tried together with this one given the  overlapping and interrelated factual issues. [3]     The basis for the application is Mr. Jiwani's assertion that  Mr. Reimer will be a necessary witness at the trial in this proceeding because  of Ms. Jiwani's claim related to a marriage agreement, which the parties  negotiated and signed in July 2015, during a reconciliation after a prior  separation. During the initial separation, Ms. Jiwani filed, but never  served, the notice of family claim, which Mr. Reimer certified. He also  provided her with legal advice regarding the marriage agreement. The parties  separated for the last time in December 2015. [4]     In the amended notice of family claim, Ms. Jiwani seeks an order  pursuant to s. 93(3) of the  Family Law Act , S.B.C. 2011, c. 25, setting  aside the marriage agreement, pleading the following: a)   the respondent  having failed to disclose significant property or other information relevant to  the negotiation of the agreement;  b)   the respondent  having taken improper advantage of the claimant's vulnerability, including her  ignorance, need or distress; and  c)   such other  circumstances which would, under the common law, cause all or part of that  contract to be voidable. [5]     The marriage agreement itself attaches various lists of assets and  liabilities as schedules. Mr. Jiwani's list and those for the corporations  in which he is the sole or controlling shareholder are attached as Schedule B,  D, and E respectively.  [6]     Ms. Jiwani alleges that during the course of this proceeding she  has learned that Mr. Jiwani has divested himself of approximately $2.847  million in funds that are subject to division as family property since their  initial separation. She also alleges he holds undisclosed accounts, has failed  to make proper CRA payments, his corporate entities have significant  outstanding CRA debts, and he has engaged in a number of other financial  transactions using family property, all of which are summarized at paras. 7, 9–11,  and 16–24 of the application response. The remaining assets, which he agrees  are family property and available to divide, says Ms. Jiwani, are funds in the  amount of approximately $1 million held in trust, which consist of the  remaining net proceeds from the sale of the family home. [7]     It has now been six years since the parties' final separation. Ms. Jiwani  has not been examined for discovery. Examinations for discovery of  Mr. Jiwani were conducted in 2017 and 2019. He has not disputed her assertion  that he has yet to produce any of the various documents and information  requested during those discoveries. [8]     Mr. Jiwani takes the position that Mr. Reimer is a necessary  witness, and as a witness, would have a conflict of interest that would  disqualify him from continuing to represent Ms. Jiwani. Mr. Jiwani  argues that by advising Ms. Jiwani to sign the marriage agreement and  observing her state of mind at the time, along perhaps with other dealings with  her, Mr. Reimer's evidence will be crucial. In making the argument,  Mr. Jiwani focuses on Ms. Jiwani's pleadings with respect to the  marriage agreement that he took improper advantage of her vulnerability, including  her ignorance, need or distress. Without addressing her affidavit evidence,  Mr. Jiwani submits the moment Ms. Jiwani says she was coerced or  under duress, which he anticipates she will, Mr. Reimer will be called as  a witness. He also suggests Mr. Reimer's evidence regarding her alleged  vulnerability is also necessary. [9]     Mr. Jiwani further argues the timing of this application, prior to the  setting of a trial date, minimizes the prejudice to her because it will allow  her time to retain and instruct new counsel.  [10]     Mr. Reimer submits that, and it is clear, Ms. Jiwani's  pleadings simply track the language of s. 93(3)(a), (b) and (d) of the  Family  Law Act . He points out that she does not rely on s. 93(3)(c), which  reads “the spouse did not understand the nature or consequence of the  agreement” and emphasizes that her state of mind is not at issue. She does not  plead undue influence, coercion, or duress, and she does not allege actual need  or distress. Mr. Reimer also suggests that leave be granted to allow her to  amend the pleadings to remove that language if the court is of the view her  pleadings require clarification. The only vulnerability she asserts is based on  ignorance arising from a lack of knowledge of the parties' assets and debts,  which she attributes to Mr. Jiwani's alleged fraud and deceit. [11]     Mr. Reimer's submissions are consistent with Ms. Jiwani's  affidavit evidence regarding the basis for her claim to set aside the marriage  agreement, the effort involved in trying to uncover the state of the parties'  assets and debts prior to the marriage agreement, and Mr. Jiwani's  financial conduct since then. [12]     There is no disagreement about the applicable legal principles which are  set out in the notice of application and application response. In summary, the  court has an inherent jurisdiction to remove a lawyer from the record who has a  conflict of interest, including a lawyer who may be a witness in a case where  they act as counsel (see  Ontario Realty Corp. v. Gabriele & Sons Limited ,  [2006] O.J. No. 4497 (Ont. S.C.J.) at para. 16 and  MacDonald Estate v.  Martin , [1990] 3 S.C.R. 1235 at para. 18). The concern that arises  when a lawyer testifies is there may be a conflict of interest between the  client and the lawyer, and the administration of justice can be impaired by a  conflict in the lawyer's obligation of objectivity to the court, and their  obligation as an advocate to the client. The factors the court considers  include: (a) maintaining the high standard of the legal profession and the  integrity of the justice system; and (b) the right of a litigant to counsel of  choice, which they should not be deprived of without good cause ( Ontario  Realty  at para. 17, citing  MacDonald Estate  at para. 12) The test to  be applied is whether a fair‑minded reasonably informed member of the  public would conclude that a proper administration of justice requires the  removal of the lawyer ( Ontario Realty  at para. 20;  Karas et al. v. Her  Majesty the Queen et al. , 2011 ONSC 5181 at para. 26). The cases have  recognized that when a litigant is deprived of a lawyer of their choice, a  hardship may arise, which can only be justified to prevent a more serious  injustice (see for example  Urquhart v. Allen Estate , [1999] O.J. No.  4816 (Ont. S.C.J.). While certainty that a lawyer will be called as a witness is  not required, the applicant must establish it is likely that counsel can  provide material evidence:  Ontario Realty  at paras. 34-35. In  Gichuru  v. Purewal , 2017 BCCA 281 at para. 17, the Court of Appeal characterized a  removal order as an extraordinary remedy, to be approached with great caution  and rarely invoked. [13]     I have no difficulty in concluding that a fair‑minded reasonably  informed member of the public would not conclude that the proper administration  of justice requires the removal of Mr. Reimer. On the contrary, I am quite  confident that a person so situated would share my view that the spectre of  injustice would only be raised by granting such an order. I have a significant  concern that this application is a strategic one. In my view it should never  have been brought. Based on the materials before me, it is quite obvious that  Ms. Jiwani's state of mind, as opposed to her state of knowledge at the  time of the marriage agreement, is not the issue. The primary, if not sole,  issue as it relates to her claim to set aside the marriage agreement is what  she understood the parties' assets and liabilities to be, and what they in fact  were and are. The evidence relevant to this issue lies not with Mr. Reimer.  Depriving Ms. Jiwani of her right to counsel of choice would cause an  undoubted hardship. Mr. Reimer has acted for her for many years in this  proceeding, which involves difficult and complex financial issues, and a very  significant and serious family debt and property claim based on allegations of  fraudulent misrepresentation and diversion of assets that have a much greater  value than the known assets. [14]     I therefore dismiss the application. [15]     Given my significant concern about the unreasonableness of the  application, I order the respondent to not only pay the claimant's costs of the  application, but to pay them forthwith. [16]     CNSL P. REIMER: It's Paul Reimer speaking. Thank you, Madam Justice,  fixing costs? [17]     THE COURT: Yes, do you have an amount to suggest? [18]     CNSL P. REIMER: Well, this has been our second day at this, I suppose  $1,500. [19]     THE COURT: Mr. Bienvenu, do you have any submissions about the  amount? [20]     CNSL J. BIENVENU: No, Madam Justice, this is ‑‑ I  mean, we sat around for a day, this is why it's the second day, my submission  would be a thousand dollars. [21]     THE COURT: Well, if it has taken up two days of counsel's time, I will  fix the amount at $1,500. [22]     CNSL P. REIMER: Thank you, Madam Justice. “Fleming  J.”"},"meta":{},"created_at":"2022-03-08T08:08:14.440215Z","updated_at":"2022-03-10T01:06:29.608219Z","project":2},{"id":42,"annotations":[{"id":48,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"start":0,"end":36,"text":"COURT OF APPEAL FOR BRITISH COLUMBIA","labels":["COURT_NAME"]},"id":"3e22211a-9","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":120,"end":133,"text":"Amalia Liapis","labels":["PERS_APPELLANT"]},"id":"3e22217e-9","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":160,"end":179,"text":"Aron Damien  Keshow","labels":["PERS_RESPONDENT"]},"id":"3e2221b0-9","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":181,"end":198,"text":"0880881 B.C.

Appellants (Respondents) And 0892868  B.C. Ltd. Respondent (Respondent  by Counterclaim) Before: The Honourable Madam Justice Newbury The Honourable Mr. Justice Groberman The Honourable Mr. Justice Abrioux On appeal from: Orders of  the Supreme Court of British Columbia, dated   August 14 and 16, 2019 ( Liapis v. Keshow , Vancouver Registry E162841).  Counsel for the Appellants: H.M. Dale Counsel for the Respondents: P.R. Albi, Q.C. S.E. Ovens Place and Date of Hearing: Vancouver, British   Columbia January 15, 2020 Place and Date of Judgment: Vancouver, British   Columbia January 28, 2020   Written Reasons of the Court   Summary: Trial judge in family law  case, being dissatisfied with expert evidence concerning the value of a major  asset, ordered that the property be sold before she made a final order for the  division of property. This order had not been sought by counsel for either  party and they had not had the opportunity to make submissions on the  possibility of such an order. Appeal allowed. Trial judge had erred in making  the order without hearing counsels’ submissions thereon, and she had not  considered other alternatives that might be preferable. Order for sale was set  aside and the case was remitted to the Supreme Court.  Reasons  for Judgment of the Court: [1]     We are all of the view that this appeal should be allowed and that the  trial in the court below should resume – if possible, before the trial judge  who has already heard several days of trial. If that is not possible, the Chief  Justice of the Supreme Court will have to nominate a new trial judge under R. 22‑2(10)  of the  Supreme Court   Family Rules .  [2]     The order under appeal was made in the course of a family law trial in  which it became necessary to determine the value of a piece of real estate. The  real estate is located in downtown Vancouver and consists of a large  commercial\/residential building called the “Boulder”. It is owned by the  respondent King Tiger Investments Ltd. (“King Tiger”), a subsidiary of the  respondent 0880881 B.C. Ltd. (the “Numbered Company”), the shares of which are  owned by Mr. Keshow (the “husband”). He is involved in a time-consuming  and complex project to re‑develop the property.  [3]     A joint expert report on the fair value of the Boulder had been filed at  trial; the claimant in this proceeding, Ms. Liapis (the “wife”), had  disagreed with it; and she sought to adduce into evidence the opinions of two  other experts. In general terms, the experts disputed the method of calculating  the cost of the planned redevelopment of the Boulder, in respect of which the  husband had successfully reached a “Heritage Revitalization Agreement” with the  City of Vancouver. The Agreement included the grant to King Tiger of so-called  “transferable density” rights. According to the husband’s testimony, the terms  of the Agreement prohibit the sale of the building without the City’s approval.   [4]     The trial commenced in October 2018 but was adjourned to February 2019  and then to early April 2019. On the 17th day of trial, both parties had filed  written submissions on the legal issues that had to be resolved. The husband  sought the equal division of the parties’ family assets and submitted that  there was no need to “force a liquidation of one of the party’s companies”,  citing  Blackett v. Blackett  (1989) 63 D.L.R. (4th) 18 (B.C.C.A.) at 23–5.  Counsel for the wife submitted that “everything about the Boulder project” was  “speculative” and as we read his argument, suggested that the Court should  determine the fair market value at $4.1 million, the amount for which a  tenant of the Boulder property had made an offer to purchase. There may be  legitimate objections to using this tenant’s offer as indicative of fair market  value. [5]     At the end of the day on April 5, 2019, the trial judge asked  counsel for the husband if she would require more time “next time we meet”.  Counsel replied that she had “a great deal more submissions” to make, but that  she had finished her submissions explaining the table of assets she had  provided to the Court. [6]     When the trial resumed on August 14, the judge told counsel she had  had time to ‘cogitate’ over the summer and had come to some decisions. The  second of these was that because she saw “substantial deficiencies” in the  expert reports, the only way she could be “confident in a fair value to be  assessed is by ordering the building to be sold.” No further reasons were  given; nor did the judge explain why the Boulder itself was to be sold rather  than the husband’s shares of the Numbered Company or the Numbered Company’s  share of King Tiger. [7]     The husband’s original notice of appeal was filed on August 28,  2019.  [8]     On September 5, 2019, the trial judge stayed the order of sale and  an ancillary order pending the husband’s appeal. The trial was also adjourned  pending appeal. [9]     On October 30, 2019, Mr. Albi on behalf of the wife wrote to  counsel for the husband as follows: Considering the issue of proportionality and having regard to  the timelines before trial arguments are concluded,  we do not consider it  expedient or in the best interests of either party for the subject appeal to  proceed .  While our position is that the  Order for Sale is appropriate having regard to the valuation evidence before  the court, in order to address concerns raised in the appeal, we will advise  the trial judge that the continuation of the trial in November that  Ms. Liapis  is prepared to agree to vacate the Order for Sale to allow the trial arguments  to be concluded before judgment is rendered on all issues . In our view,  this will allow full argument on whether an Order for Sale should be granted,  and will render the appeal of the Order for Sale unnecessary. [Emphasis added.]   Strangely, counsel for the husband did not accept this  offer, apparently because she regarded it as offering only a ‘suspension’ of  the order for sale and believed that it was “too late” to get a “fair” solution  from the trial judge.  [10]     It is unfortunate that counsel misunderstood Mr. Albi’s offer,  especially since in this court, both counsel acknowledged that neither party  had been afforded the right to be heard on the issue of whether the Boulder  should be sold before the judge divided the parties’ property. The sale of the  Boulder was at best premature; and  if  some division becomes necessary  under the  Family Law Act,  a better method might well be to re‑allocate  corporate shares rather than to sell the property itself. Obviously, shares can  be divided in a way real estate cannot, and various taxes and fees, as well as  negotiations with the City, might be avoided. [11]     In the circumstances, we are of the view that the sale order and the  ancillary order should be set aside. The only remaining question for this court  is whether it will be necessary to order a new trial or whether the trial can  simply continue before the trial judge. This is complicated by the fact that  the judge has announced she is retiring effective May 30, 2020.  [12]     Ms. Dale argued initially before us that the trial judge had  breached the rules of procedural fairness in making the sale order without  hearing full argument on the issue from counsel and that her client should not  be required to go back before a judge who has “made her mind up” on the  question of sale. Counsel referred us to a number of cases, including  Boury  v. Iten  2019 BCCA 81. In that instance, a judge in chambers had made an  (interlocutory) order in respect of which he had received written submissions  but had not heard oral argument from counsel. This court ruled that the judge  had thereby breached the rules of procedural fairness. In Tysoe J.A.’s  words:  … The legal argument to be set  out in the Notice of Application is not intended to be a substitute for oral  submissions or more elaborate written arguments permitted by R. 8‑1(16)  in the event the hearing of an application will take more than two hours. Two  of the valuable functions of oral advocacy are to answer questions the judge  may have and to phrase submissions in a persuasive fashion that may be slightly  different from legal arguments set out in the Notice of Application or written  submissions. [At para. 32.] Since it was not “plain and obvious” the procedural error  had not affected the outcome, the Court remitted the application to the Supreme  Court for a new hearing. (At paras. 44–5; see also  Felker v. Felker   [1946] O.W.N. 368 (Ont. C.A.);  Investors Group Financial Services Inc.  v. Corby  2005 BCSC 666.)  [13]     We are concerned here, however, with an interlocutory order made by a  trial judge mid-trial. As we told Ms. Dale, this court often refers  matters back to trial judges after correcting errors of law or fact. It is  assumed the trial judge will proceed without any predisposition against the  successful appellant. This was not an instance in which a truly discretionary  order was made that might justify a litigant in perceiving a predisposition on  the judge’s part. (Ms. Dale confirmed she was not alleging bias on the  part of the trial judge, in which event cases such as  Malton v. Attia   2016 ABCA 130 would have been relevant.) [14]     In our discussions with counsel, Ms. Dale conceded that as long as  the trial judge was aware of the “correct test” applicable to the question of  when a sale of property such as the Boulder is required under the  Family Law  Act , S.B.C. 2011, c. 25, an order of this court remitting the matter  to the trial judge would be an appropriate “remedy”. Mr. Albi was also  content to have the question of sale determined by the trial judge  at the  end of trial,  not as a means of determining value but as a method of  dividing it between the parties after proper argument. [15]     It is obvious, in our view, that the sale order and the ancillary order  should not have been made until the trial judge had heard counsels’ submissions  and considered all relevant factors under the  Family Law Act , including  whether a sale of the real estate would affect the Heritage Revitalization  Agreement and rights related thereto, the advantages and disadvantages to each  of the parties, and (if a division  is  found to be necessary) whether an  apportionment of corporate shares might be a preferable alternative. Further,  we note that while valuation issues are often difficult, trial judges must at  the end of the day do the best they can with the evidence they have. As stated  by this court in  Cyprus Anvil Mining Corp. v. Dickson  (1986) 33 D.L.R.  (4th) 641: The one  true rule is to consider all the evidence that might be helpful, and to  consider the particular factors in the particular case, and to exercise the  best judgment that can be brought to bear on all the evidence and all the  factors. I emphasize: it is a question of judgment. No apology need be offered  for that. Parliament has decreed that fair value be determined by the courts  and not by a formula that can be stated in the legislation. [At 652.] [16]     In the result, we would allow the appeal, set aside the sale order and  the ancillary order, and remit all outstanding issues to the trial judge for  determination. We acknowledge that it may not be possible for her to hear this  matter before her retirement, in which case the Chief Justice of the Supreme  Court will have to cconsider making an order under   R. 22‑2(10)  of the  Supreme Court Family Rules , and a new judge will have to  determine how to conduct the trial under R. 22‑2(11).   “The Honourable Madam Justice Newbury”  “The Honourable Mr. Justice Groberman”  “The Honourable Mr. Justice Abrioux”"},"meta":{},"created_at":"2022-03-08T08:08:14.439871Z","updated_at":"2022-03-10T01:04:18.845838Z","project":2},{"id":40,"annotations":[{"id":46,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"start":3,"end":40,"text":"THE SUPREME COURT OF BRITISH COLUMBIA","labels":["COURT_NAME"]},"id":"3e22338a-9","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":444,"end":480,"text":"The Honourable Mr. Justice Macintosh","labels":["PERS_JUDGE"]},"id":"3e2233bc-9","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":5649,"end":5662,"text":"Macintosh  J.","labels":["PERS_JUDGE"]},"id":"3e223402-9","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":166,"end":182,"text":"Diana Nam H.

G.A. Consulting Services Inc.,   2020 BCSC 125 Date: 20200107 Docket: S188110 Registry:  Vancouver Between: Diana Nam H. Mau, Christina  Mau Nowik, Joanna Mau Nowik   and Diana Mau Financial Corporation Plaintiffs\/   Defendants by Counterclaim And G.A. Consulting  Services Inc.   Katie Mak Accounting Corp. and   Diana Mau Corporation Defendants\/   Plaintiffs by Counterclaim Before:  The Honourable Mr. Justice Macintosh Oral Reasons for Judgment Counsel for Plaintiffs\/Defendants by Counterclaim: S.M. MacKenzie Counsel for Defendants\/Plaintiffs by Counterclaim: J.K. Bienvenu Place and Date of Trial: Vancouver, B.C. January 7, 2020  Place and Date of Judgment: Vancouver, B.C. January 7, 2020    [1]     These brief reasons address the Defendants’ argument that the Plaintiffs’  case is not suitable for disposition by summary trial. The Plaintiffs’ summary  trial application was set for today and scheduled for one day only. [2]     Having heard the Plaintiffs’ review of the evidence and facts for most  of this morning, and in part this afternoon, and now having also heard the  parties’ submissions as to suitability, I have concluded in the circumstances  set out below, notwithstanding Mr. MacKenzie’s able submissions, that it  would be unjust to proceed further by summary trial in this complex case, and  that the Plaintiffs’ summary trial application ought not to proceed further. [3]     The three personal Plaintiffs are a mother, who is an accountant, and  her two daughters, who, with their mother, are the three shareholders in the  mother’s accounting business. [4]     By a share purchase agreement, the three personal Plaintiffs were to  sell their shares in the accounting business to the first two named Defendants.  The Plaintiffs now sue primarily for non-payment on the sale of their shares,  but additional relief is also sought. The Defendants defend and counterclaim  because they allege the first Plaintiff, Ms. Mau, failed to deliver to the  Defendants the accounting clients she had allegedly promised to deliver,  refused to sign a consulting agreement, and otherwise breached the share  purchase agreement. [5]     Counsel for both sides agree that the written share purchase agreement  is “far from perfect” in its clarity. In addition to the share purchase  agreement itself, the case requires the consideration of draft agreements, oral  agreements, and the Plaintiffs’ claim for rectification of clause 3.2(a) in the  share purchase agreement in accordance with para. 23 pleaded in the  amended notice of civil claim. [6]     There are two practical considerations which form an important part of  the basis for my conclusion. [7]     First, in my view, the summary trial application could not conclude in  only one day. Two days would be required, and I believe even that would be a  tight estimate. By midday today, the Plaintiffs had not quite concluded their  review of the evidence and facts, and had not begun their legal submissions. The  suitability submissions only began at about 12:15 midday. They continued at  2:00 p.m. The Defendants’ case on the merits has not yet begun. I add that the Plaintiffs’  review of the evidence and facts has progressed as far as it has only because Plaintiffs’  counsel, who is fully on top of his brief, packed an enormous amount of complex  information into the time he had. I should add too, as another reality, that I  am hearing another matter tomorrow, and I am then away until January 27th,  followed by other court commitments on my return. [8]     The second practical point is that the parties have reserved a five-day  trial for this matter beginning in approximately two months, that is, on March  9, 2020. [9]     From the time  Inspiration Management  was decided by our Court of  Appeal in 1989, this Court has proceeded to employ the summary trial rules  robustly.  [10]     However, there clearly are cases, of which this is one, where the Court  would be greatly assisted by hearing from the key witnesses. When it is kept in  mind that five trial days are available just two months from now, I believe it  would be unjust not to hear from those witnesses in the hope of turning complex  facts into facts that are more readily understandable. In particular, as one  example, a judge will want to have a better understanding of whether both sides  were properly performing their obligations around the consulting agreement,  whether written or oral. [11]     I am mindful of the cost of a five-day trial, but the sums at issue here  are not trivial, and the pretrial steps, including several discoveries, have  already occurred. [12]     The remainder of these reasons are subject to the directions of the  trial judge, who may disagree with and override what I set out below depending  on her or his assessment as the case nears trial. [13]     I recommend that counsel, with my support, seek a case management  conference before the judge who will hear the trial. [14]     I also recommend that the trial be a hybrid trial, so that evidence is  introduced by both affidavit and oral evidence. The three volumes of materials  before me today would form part of the evidentiary record. In addition, each  side could call one witness, probably Ms. Mau for the Plaintiffs and Ms. Fong  or Ms. Mak for the Defendants. [15]     I will ask Mr. MacKenzie to keep my copy of the three volumes of  evidence used today and give them to the trial judge as her or his copy to use  at trial if the judge decides to proceed as I have recommended above. [16]     Costs of today are costs in the cause. “Macintosh  J.”"},"meta":{},"created_at":"2022-03-08T08:08:14.439629Z","updated_at":"2022-03-10T00:53:28.622099Z","project":2},{"id":39,"annotations":[{"id":45,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"start":3,"end":41,"text":"THE SUPREME COURT OF BRITISH COLUMBIA ","labels":["COURT_NAME"]},"id":"3e2237b8-9","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":211,"end":256,"text":"Peninsula (Kingsway)  Seafood Restaurant Inc.","labels":["PERS_APPELLANT"]},"id":"3e2237ea-9","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":272,"end":303,"text":"Central Park  Developments Ltd.","labels":["PERS_RESPONDENT"]},"id":"3e223830-9","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":308,"end":332,"text":"Fraser Healthy Authority","labels":["PERS_RESPONDENT"]},"id":"3e22386c-9","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":354,"end":390,"text":"The Honourable Mr. Justice Macintosh","labels":["PERS_JUDGE"]},"id":"3e223894-9","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":445,"end":460,"text":"C.R.

Central   Park Developments Ltd.,   2021 BCSC 119 Date: 20210107 Docket: S2012660 Registry:  Vancouver Between: Peninsula (Kingsway)  Seafood Restaurant Inc. Petitioner And Central Park  Developments Ltd. and Fraser Healthy Authority Respondents Before:  The Honourable Mr. Justice Macintosh Oral Reasons for Judgment Counsel for the Petitioner: C.R. Rubinstein Counsel for the Respondent, Central Park Developments Ltd.: A.P. Morrison Counsel for the Respondent, Fraser Healthy Authority: N. Lapper E. Moore, Articled   Student Place and Date of Hearing: Vancouver, B.C. January 4, 2021 Place and Date of Judgment: Vancouver, B.C. January 7, 2021   [1]     The Petitioner, Peninsula (Kingsway) Seafood Restaurant Inc. (“Peninsula”),  was the commercial tenant of premises at 4555 Kingsway in Burnaby. It applies  for relief from forfeiture. The landlord, the Respondent, Central Park  Developments Ltd. (“Central Park”), lawfully terminated the lease on the ground  that Peninsula had not paid rent on time. Central Park has now accepted an  offer to lease the same premises from the Respondent, Fraser Health Authority  (“Fraser Health”).  [2]     The parties have agreed to an 11-page statement of facts, including a  letter signed by Central Park and Fraser Health on December 17, 2020, removing  their subject conditions from the offer to lease. I attach as Schedule A to  these reasons, as forming part of these reasons, the agreed statement of facts,  including the letter. One should read Schedule A before proceeding to read the  balance of these reasons. [3]     Peninsula relies on s. 24 of the  Law and Equity Act , R.S.B.C.  1996, c. 253. It says simply that: The court may relieve against all  penalties and forfeitures, and in granting the relief may impose any terms as  to costs, expenses, damages, compensations, and all other matters that the  court thinks fit. [4]     Sechelt Golf & Country Club Ltd. v. District of Sechelt , 2012  BCSC 1105 at paras. 138 and 139, sets out factors to be applied and considered  in deciding whether the party in default ought to be granted relief from  forfeiture. Those paragraphs provide as follows: [138] Relief from forfeiture is a purely discretionary  remedy. No party is entitled to this relief as of right. Saskatchewan River Bungalows Ltd. v. Maritime Life  Assurance Co. , [1994] 2 S.C.R. 490 at 504 (S.C.C.) [139] A summary of the applicable principles to be  considered in deciding whether SGCC ought to be granted relief from forfeiture  on the facts of this case include: (a) whether the sum forfeited is  out of all proportion to the loss suffered ( Pope v. Potter , 2011 BCSC  697 at para. 23); (b) whether it would be  unconscionable in the traditional equitable sense for relief not to be granted  ( Pope  at paras. 24-25); (c) the applicant’s conduct, the  gravity of the breaches and the disparity between the value of the property  forfeited and the damage caused by the breach ( Saskatchewan River Bungalows   at 504); (d) whether there are any  collateral equitable grounds which exist including the party coming to court  with “unclean hands” ( 600433 B.C. Ltd. v. XJ Motors Ltd. , 2011 BCSC 1144  at para. 34); (e) whether the applicant is  “prepared now to do what is right and fair, but must also show his past record in  the transaction is clean” ( Snell’s Equity  (29th ed., 1990) at 31 and  541-542.). See also:  British Columbia Development Corporation v. NAB  Holdings Ltd.  (1986), 6 B.C.L.R. (2d) 145 (C.A.). [5]     I note that when Justice Abrioux, as he then was, in  Sechelt  set  out factors (a) to (e), he described them specifically in the context of the Sechelt  Golf & Country Club, in a case where there was no third party interest such  as there in this case because of Fraser Health. Perhaps it can be said that  “collateral equitable grounds” in (d) from  Sechelt , quoted above, takes  into account a third party lease interest, although I expect such an interest  would have received more explicit recognition in  Sechelt  had it been  present in the facts of that case. The presence of Fraser Health’s interest as  the prospective new tenant alters the analysis, and must be added as a  significant factor to the five factors listed in  Sechelt , assuming that  “collateral equitable grounds” in factor (d) from  Sechelt  is not  intended to address third party leasehold interests. [6]     The Respondents submit that the accepted offer to lease is determinative  of the matter, such that the Court must not exercise its discretion, and is  therefore without discretion, to grant the relief against forfeiture that is  being requested. Alternatively, the Respondents appear to accept that the  accepted offer to lease is at least a significant factor against the relief  being granted, as I have found it to be. [7]     The following three cases, two from this province, address the relevance  of a third party lease interest in applications for relief from forfeiture.  [8]     Justice Locke, as a member of this Court, said, as  dicta , in  Gleneagle  Manor Ltd. v. Finn's of Kerrisdale Ltd. , [1980] B.C.J. No. 94 (S.C.) at  para. 37: [37] The principle running through the cases is that if the  landlord can be compensated in money,  and there are no intervening third  party rights , a Court will at least consider the matter.  [Emphasis added.] [9]     His Lordship’s comment about intervening third party rights was brief, I  expect because nobody in that case had acquired any third party rights, the  absence of which His Lordship treated as a factor in favour of the tenant who  was seeking relief from forfeiture. [10]     The Saskatchewan Court of Queen’s Bench had to consider third party  lease interests more fully in a case where the landlord had accepted a third  party’s offer to lease in  H.S.H. Restaurant Inc. v. Lakeview Mall Inc. ,  [1986] S.J. No. 197. The Court refused to grant the tenant relief from  forfeiture, relying heavily on the third party lease interest after having  considered the applicable law as follows at paras. 18-20 of the decision: [18] Although relief from forfeiture is a discretionary  matter and falls within the equitable jurisdiction of the court, certain  principles have evolved through the decisions of the courts. Generally, unless  there are exceptional circumstances, the court will grant relief from  forfeiture when arrears of rent and costs have been paid. See:  Hunt ling v.  MacAdam , [1908] W.L.R. 214; 13 B.C.R. 426; and  Gill et al. v. Lewis et  al , [1956] 2 Q.B. 1. However, in the case of  Stanhope v. Haworth , 3  T.L.R. 34, the court held that the tenant was not entitled to relief from  forfeiture where the application for relief was made almost six months after  default judgment and possession, during which time the position of the landlord  had altered since he kept up the colliery at his expense and other parties had  paid out money in purchasing the plant and were now in possession. [19] In the case of  Newbolt v. Bingham et al , 72  L.T.R. 852, at p. 853, Lord Esher, M.R., stated the law to be as follows: If, at the time relief is asked  for, the position has been altered, so that relief could not be given without  causing injury to third parties. I think that the case that was cited to us ( Stanhope  v. Haworth ) applies . But if, at the time of the application, the  position is not altered, so that no injustice will be done, I think, if the  conditions mentioned in the section are complied with, that, according to the  settled practice in equity, there is no longer a discretion in the judge, but  that he ought to make the order. It does not matter whether it is called  discretionary or not, if the discretion ought always to be exercised in one  way. If the conditions are complied with,  and no interests of third parties  have intervened , there is no longer any real discretion in the matter. [20] In the case of  Gleneagle Manor Ltd. et al. v.  Film’s of Kerrisdale Ltd. et al  (1981), 116 D.L.R. (3d) 617, Lock, J.,  reviewed numerous authorities and then at p. 627 stated: The principle running through the  cases is that if the landlord can be compensated in money,  and there are no  intervening third party rights , a court will at least consider the matter. [Emphasis added.] [11]     Finally, I refer to  600433 B.C. Ltd. v. XJ Motors Ltd. , 2011 BCSC  1144. There Justice Burnyeat, after finding that the Court retained the  discretion to grant relief against forfeiture, even though the interests of a  third party had intervened (see para. 45), refused to grant the relief, and  cited as one of his grounds for the refusal the fact that the property had been  re-let. Quoting in part from para. 54 o’f Justice Burnyeat's reasons: [54] I have also concluded that  relief from forfeiture should not be granted because the Property has been  re-let. The presence of the New Lease would result in XJ being obligated to pay  considerable damages if this new tenant was required to give up vacant  possession in order that the Plaintiff could go into occupation again … [12]     Returning to the agreed facts, amplified slightly by me based on the  filed affidavit evidence, one sees that Peninsula has been persistently late in  its obligation to pay rent over the three and a half years of the lease,  including in the years and months before COVID-19. [13]     Central Park, throughout, acted as a reasonable and relatively  accommodating landlord, entering a lease amendment in June 2018 to postpone  Peninsula’s obligation to pay basic rent, another lease amendment in April of  2020 to give Peninsula another postponement of rent, and a rent deferral  agreement in July of 2020 again serving to postpone Peninsula’s rent  obligations. Central Park issued a default of rent notice in the fall of 2018,  again in the summer of 2020, and finally in October of 2020. The rent defaults  themselves were numerous (see agreed statement of facts, Schedule A, paras. 16,  19, 21, 22, 29, 35, 40, 46 and 50). [14]     Central Park lawfully terminated the Peninsula lease on October 16,  2020. It wrote to Peninsula and the two “indemnifiers” (essentially guarantors)  on October 23, 2020, as follows: To Whom It May Concern: Further to our Notice of Termination issued to you on October  16, 2020, we understand that you have communicated with our bailiff  representative and have requested to pay the arrears of rent and reinstate the  Lease. We hereby advise you that the Landlord will not reinstate the  Lease. We acknowledge your communications with the bailiff, but,  respectfully, the time to have communicated with us and preserve the Lease was  after we issued to you the Notices of Default, and not now after the  termination of the Lease has been issued. We confirm that we provided to you  three Notices of Default, after all of which we received no reply. Unfortunately, we no longer have confidence in the ability of  the Tenant to pay the rent on an ongoing, timely basis, nor confidence that the  establishment will be open for profitable business in the near future. We also note that there is no longer any value in the  covenants of the Indemnifiers of the Lease. The current state of the covenants  of the Tenant and the Indemnifiers, and the failure of the Tenant to pay rent  on time and communicate with us after the Notices of Default, have resulted in  our decision to terminate and not re-instate the Lease. We did not take this decision  lightly, and will be as cooperative as possible with you, but in the foregoing  context. For clarity, you remain responsible for payment of the  arrears of rent, the enforcement expenses of the Landlord, and losses  associated with the Landlord losing the benefit of the Lease over the unexpired  portion of the Term. We are proceeding to re-lease the Premises to mitigate our  damages, as required under law. This letter is without prejudice  to any of our rights, powers, privileges, remedies and defences, now existing  or hereafter arising, all of which are hereby expressly reserved. [15]     On October 26, 2020, Peninsula advised that it wanted to stay at the  premises. It notified Central Park of this application on November 9, and filed  this petition on November 26. The matter was to be heard December 17, but I  gather no judge was available then. [16]     Central Park, having lawfully terminated the Peninsula lease on October  16, 2020, accepted the November 2   offer to lease from Fraser Health  on November 13. As noted earlier, Central Park and Fraser Health, on December  17, 2020, removed the subject conditions from the offer to lease. Fraser Health  obtained legal occupancy of the premises on January 1, 2021. Fraser Health  presented detailed evidence in the affidavit of Lenia Calico filed December 14,  2020, demonstrating the importance of this site, given its particular location  in Burnaby, its street access, and its size, in order for Fraser Health to  establish a large primary care facility. It appears from the evidence that such  sites are not readily available. The lease term with Fraser Health is 10 years. [17]     Before returning to the five criteria, or factors, in  Sechelt ,  listed earlier in these reasons, I note that Central Park has little practical  recourse against Peninsula for future rent arrears or other costs or expenses  incurred from this somewhat difficult tenancy. Peninsula, although a BC  company, has no assets in BC, or apparently elsewhere, and is not in good  standing with the Registrar of Companies. The two indemnifiers or guarantors  for Peninsula are, or were, BC companies, but they have been struck from the  registry or are not in good standing. [18]     The evidence is that whenever Peninsula has been placed in funds to pay  Central Park, those funds have come in from China. In other words, in this  province, Peninsula is judgment-proof. [19]     Although a number of the criteria from  Sechelt  lend some support  to Peninsula on this application, as I will address below, I have concluded  from all of the facts, and in particular the now unconditional accepted offer  to lease from Fraser Health, that the application for relief from forfeiture  must be denied. Where, as here, a landlord has lawfully terminated a lease and  then lawfully entered into a  bona fide  and substantial lease arrangement  with an innocent third party, there is a compelling case for allowing the third  party rights to trump the wishes of the original tenant in default. Further, it  appears at this stage that Fraser Health has the lawful right to sue Central  Park if Central Park reneges on the new lease, where damages could be  substantial. The Court’s discretion should not ordinarily be exercised so as to  subject a party in Central Park’s position to third party claims where that  party, Central Park, has acted lawfully and reasonably throughout. [20]     Turning to the  Sechelt  criteria, Peninsula will have substantial  costs thrown away, very roughly, in the range of $2 million expended on rent  and improvements for a restaurant it never opened. Under factor (b), however,  it cannot be unconscionable in equity to deny relief where, as here, a landlord  acting lawfully and reasonably has engaged the substantial lawful interests of  a third party. [21]     Under factor (c), Peninsula’s conduct has been that of a tenant  persistently demonstrating that it is reluctant to meet its rent obligations,  and often doing so only when forced to. Many of its emails vying for time for  delayed rent are masterpieces for leading a creditor along without quite  amounting to bad faith or evidence of unclean hands. Now that the lease has  been terminated, Peninsula has been generous in offering to immediately pay the  relatively small outstanding rent arrears, and to deposit approximately  $450,000 toward future rent payments. I have spoken earlier about collateral  equitable grounds in criterion (d) as possibly including third party interests.  Whether Fraser Health’s interests are to be weighed under that criterion or  separately, they are, as I have indicated, the interests that tip the scale on  this application against Peninsula. Under  Sechelt  criterion (e), while I  would not conclude that Peninsula has unclean hands, it has not been a diligent  tenant at any stage in the course of the lease term. [22]     Were it not for the presence of the Fraser Health lease interest, I  would, with reluctance, have allowed relief from forfeiture. In my view,  however, the Fraser Health lease is the overwhelming factor toward the  conclusion that I should dismiss Peninsula’s application, which I do. [23]     I thank counsel for their helpful submissions. “Macintosh  J.” Schedule A  "},"meta":{},"created_at":"2022-03-08T08:08:14.439542Z","updated_at":"2022-03-10T00:52:26.206579Z","project":2},{"id":38,"annotations":[{"id":44,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"start":0,"end":36,"text":"COURT OF APPEAL FOR BRITISH COLUMBIA","labels":["COURT_NAME"]},"id":"3e22471c-9","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":115,"end":122,"text":" Regina","labels":["PERS_RESPONDENT"]},"id":"3e224762-9","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":138,"end":152,"text":"Tejwant Danjou","labels":["PERS_APPELLANT"]},"id":"3e224794-9","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":14734,"end":14769,"text":"The Honourable Chief Justice Bauman","labels":["PERS_JUDGE"]},"id":"3e2247c6-9","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":578,"end":592,"text":"Chief Justice ","labels":["PERS_JUDGE"]},"id":"3e2247f8-9","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":1239,"end":1252,"text":"Chief Justice","labels":["PERS_JUDGE"]},"id":"3e22482a-9","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":708,"end":722,"text":"D.

Direction of the  Chief Justice on an Application for Review   Pursuant to Section 680 of the  Criminal Code of Canada . Counsel for the Applicant: D. Turko, Q.C. S.L. Dawson Counsel for the Respondent: M. Lefebure S. McCallum Written Submissions of the Applicant Filed: December 13, 2018 and    January 7, 2019 Written Submissions of the Respondent Filed: January 4, 2019 Place and Date of Judgment: Vancouver, British   Columbia January 15, 2019     Summary: The applicant is charged  with second degree murder in relation to the death of his common-law partner. He  applied for release pending trial and his application was dismissed. He now  applies for a direction from the Chief Justice that the decision be reviewed by  a division of this Court. Held: Application dismissed. It is not arguable that  the chambers judge committed material errors of fact or law, or that the  decision was clearly unwarranted. Reasons for Judgment of the Honourable  Chief Justice Bauman: [1]     Tejwant Danjou seeks an order under s. 680 of the  Criminal Code ,  R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46 to direct the Court of Appeal to review a bail  decision made by Beames J. on 27 September 2018. [2]     For the following reasons, I find that the bail judge did not arguably  commit any material errors of fact or law. Nor is it arguable that the decision  was clearly unwarranted in the circumstances. As a result I dismiss the  application. [3]     A publication ban applies to this case under s. 517 of the  Code .  The s. 517 ban prohibits the publication, broadcast or transmission in any  way of the evidence, information and representations at the bail hearing and  the bail judge’s reasons. The ban will expire when the trial ends. Until then,  reasons for judgment on this review application and any subsequent review  decision should not be published. [4]     Mr. Danjou is charged with the second-degree murder of Rama  Gauravarapu, with whom he had been in a common-law relationship since 2015. The  Crown alleges that Mr. Danjou and the victim had been on a winery tour,  got in an argument, then returned separately to the hotel. The Crown alleges Mr. Danjou  beat the victim, then fled. The victim was pronounced dead at the scene and Mr. Danjou  was found shortly thereafter in a dumpster. [5]     At trial Mr. Danjou expects to raise defences including  intoxication, diminished capacity, provocation, and non-insane automatism. [6]     The bail judge denied the application for bail pending trial. [7]     The bail judge summarized the events surrounding the offences as  follows: [2] The victim was killed on July 22, 2018, at the  Best Western Hotel in West Kelowna. On autopsy, she was found to have suffered  over 50 injuries, including multiple blows to the head, a cut jugular vein, and  defensive wounds on her hands. There was extensive blood splatter in the room  in which she was killed, on the floor and the walls and small amounts on the  ceiling. Some of the blood splatter was observed to contain human tissue. [3] Crown counsel has provided a detailed review of  the circumstances alleged by Crown which I will not set out in full. Suffice it  to say that there is evidence that the accused and the victim had been on a  winery visit earlier in the day, that is on July 22, 2018. They were, according  to Crown's submissions, seen to have an argument or arguments of some sort and  left the winery in separate cabs. On return to the hotel which they had checked  into the previous day, the accused checked into a second room. He then left the  hotel to get cigarettes and apparently to visit the Greyhound bus depot to make  inquiries about taking a bus to the Lower Mainland.  [4] He returned to the hotel and was seen on  surveillance video to enter the room then occupied by the victim. A short while  later, guests in the room immediately below the victim's room reported hearing  loud noises and a staff member went to the door of the room. She thought she  heard a fight happening inside the room and so, concerned about her safety, she  went to get extra help. When she found her co-worker was busy, she returned to  the room and knocked. A male inside initially refused to open the door,  rejecting any assistance on her part, but when she persisted, the door was  opened and she was able to see a woman, lying on the floor, with swollen eyes,  in what appeared to be a lot of blood. The woman appeared to be having  difficulty breathing and asked the staff person to call the police. The man  inside the room said, \"Don't call the police. She doesn't need help\". [5] The employee,  according to the statement she has provided to this point in time, backed out  of the room, returned to the lobby and called 9-1-1. By the time the police  attended, the man had fled. He was found, with the assistance of a police dog,  in a dumpster a relatively short distance from the hotel. The accused was  assisted from the dumpster, arrested and transported to the hospital. By this  time, the paramedics had responded to the victim and had pronounced the victim  to be dead. [8]     The bail judge acknowledged that because Mr. Danjou was accused of  second degree murder, the burden lay on Mr. Danjou to show why his  detention was not justified:  Code , s. 522(2). [9]     The bail judge concluded Mr. Danjou had met his burden in respect  to the primary and secondary grounds for detention. The bail judge concluded Mr. Danjou’s  ties to the community meant he was not a risk of failing to attend court. The  bail judge also concluded that detention was not required to protect the public  or prevent Mr. Danjou from committing further offences. [10]     The bail judge thus focused on the tertiary ground: whether further  detention was “necessary to maintain confidence in the administration of  justice”:  Code , s. 515(10)(c). The bail judge considered this  provision in light of the Supreme Court of Canada’s guidance in  R. v.  St-Cloud , 2015 SCC 27. The section provides that detention is justified: (c) if the detention is necessary to maintain  confidence in the administration of justice, having regard to all the  circumstances, including (i) the apparent strength of the prosecution’s case, (ii) the gravity of the offence, (iii) the circumstances  surrounding the commission of the offence, including whether a firearm was  used, and (iv) the fact that the accused  is liable, on conviction, for a potentially lengthy term of imprisonment or, in  the case of an offence that involves, or whose subject-matter is, a firearm, a  minimum punishment of imprisonment for a term of three years or more. [11]     The bail judge considered the four factors outlined in s. 515(10)(c)  and concluded that the Crown’s case was “very strong” despite the defences Mr. Danjou  purported to raise, that the offence is “very grave”, that the offence was  “violent” and that if convicted, Mr. Danjou could face life imprisonment. The  bail judge acknowledged that these four factors are not exhaustive, and at para.  15 of her reasons, the bail judge considered that the ultimate question was  whether  detention is necessary to  maintain confidence in the administration of justice from the perspective of a  reasonable person properly informed who is not a legal expert and not  necessarily able to appreciate the subtleties of the various defences available  to the accused. [12]     This paragraph echoed  St-Cloud ’s guidance that s. 515(10)(c)  requires considering whether a reasonable member of the public would continue  to have confidence in the administration of justice: [ 79 ] Thus, a reasonable member of the  public is familiar with the basics of the rule of law in our country and with  the fundamental values of our criminal law, including those that are protected  by the Charter. Such a person is undoubtedly aware of the importance  of the presumption of innocence and the right to liberty in our society and  knows that these are fundamental rights guaranteed by our Constitution. He or  she also expects that someone charged with a crime will be tried within a  reasonable period of time, and is aware of the adage that “justice delayed is  justice denied”:  R. v. Trout , 2006 MBCA 96, 205 Man. R.  (2d) 277, at para. 15. Finally, a reasonable member of the public knows  that a criminal offence requires proof of culpable intent ( mens rea ) and  that the purpose of certain defences is to show the absence of such intent. A  well-known example of this type of defence is the mental disorder defence. The  person contemplated by s. 515(10)(c)  Cr. C . therefore  understands that such a defence, once established, will enable an accused to  avoid criminal responsibility. However, it would be going too far to expect the  person in question to master all the subtleties of complex defences, especially  where there is overwhelming evidence of the crime, the circumstances of the  crime are heinous and the accused admits committing it. [ 80 ] In  short, the person in question in s. 515(10)(c)  Cr. C.  is  a thoughtful person, not one who is prone to emotional reactions, whose  knowledge of the circumstances of a case is inaccurate or who disagrees with  our society’s fundamental values. But he or she is not a legal expert familiar  with all the basic principles of the criminal justice system, the elements of  criminal offences or the subtleties of criminal intent and of the defences that  are available to accused persons. [13]     The bail judge concluded that Mr. Danjou had not met his burden and  so declined to order his release. [14]     Mr. Danjou submits that the bail judge erred in principle by  improperly considering what the perspective of a reasonable person properly  informed per  St-Cloud  must be. Mr. Danjou submits that the public  would be sympathetic to individuals who may have had a break with reality or  have diminished capacity. Mr. Danjou further submits that the bail judge  erred by finding the expected defences were too complicated for the public to  understand. Mr. Danjou also submits that the tertiary ground is reserved  for cases that “shock the community” and that the four factors in s. 515(10)(c)  do not reach “their highest levels” in his case. [15]     The Crown submits the bail judge made no errors, and that the impugned  language from the bail judge reflects  St-Cloud . The Crown also submits,  as it submitted at the bail hearing, that there is no evidence to support the  defences raised by Mr. Danjou. Finally, the Crown submits that Mr. Danjou  mistakes the scope of the tertiary ground and that  St-Cloud  necessitates  a far more liberal reading. [16]     Section 680(1) of the  Code  reads:  680 (1) A decision made by a  judge under section 522 or subsection 524(4) or (5) or a decision made by a  judge of the court of appeal under section 261 or 679 may, on the direction of  the chief justice or acting chief justice of the court of appeal, be reviewed  by that court and that court may, if it does not confirm the decision, (a) vary  the decision; or (b) substitute  such other decision as, in its opinion, should have been made. [17]     The Supreme Court of Canada interpreted s. 680 in the context of  bail pending appeal in  R. v. Oland , 2017 SCC 17.  Oland  describes  that the threshold for directing a review is whether it is arguable that the bail  judge committed material errors of fact or law, or whether the impugned  decision was clearly unwarranted in the circumstances. The parties have not  argued that  Oland  applies differently in the context of bail pending  trial, as is the case here, so I will proceed with the analysis on the basis  that  Oland  applies in the same manner to bail pending trial as bail  pending appeal. [18]     I do not find it arguable that the bail judge committed material errors  of fact or law and do not see the bail judge’s decision as clearly unwarranted.  The bail judge correctly identified the offence as grave and correctly assessed  the potentially lengthy incarceration facing Mr. Danjou. Mr. Danjou has  not shown that the bail judge misconstrued his likelihood of success at trial,  nor has Mr. Danjou pointed to any error in the bail judge’s assessment of  the evidence. [19]     I do not view the bail judge as resting her decision on whether a  reasonable member of the public could not understand the subtleties of the  defence; rather, the bail judge was simply reiterating the  St-Cloud  test.  The bail judge assessed the expected defences as overly weak, not as overly  subtle. Mr. Danjou does not assert that the bail judge fundamentally  misunderstood or underestimated the strength of the defences he sought to  raise, and I have been given no reason to question the bail judge’s assessment  of the probability of conviction. [20]     As for the submission that the tertiary ground is limited to cases that  would shock the community, it is simply incorrect. As  St-Cloud  explains  at para. 87: ·     Section 515(10)(c)  Cr. C.  does not create a  residual ground for detention that applies only where the first two grounds for  detention ((a) and (b)) are not satisfied. It is a distinct ground that itself  provides a basis for ordering the pre-trial detention of an accused. ·     Section 515(10)(c)  Cr. C.  must  not be interpreted narrowly (or applied sparingly) and should not be applied  only in rare cases or exceptional circumstances or only to certain types of crimes. [21]     The bail judge made no arguable error of fact or law in her  consideration s. 515(10)(c). [22]     I take Mr. Danjou’s submission that the four factors of s. 515(10)(c)  do not reach the “highest levels” to argue that even if the bail judge had  properly considered the law, Mr. Danjou’s detention was “clearly  unwarranted” under  Oland .

Before: The   Honourable Mr. Justice Harris The   Honourable Mr. Justice Savage The   Honourable Madam Justice Fisher On appeal from: Orders of the Supreme Court of British  Columbia,   dated January 9, 2017 ( R. v. Horswill,  2017 BCSC 35,   Prince George Registry 37592) and dated January 9, 2017,   ( R. v. Horswill , 2017 BCSC 160, Prince George Registry 37592). Counsel for   the Appellant: T.M. Arbogast Counsel for   the Respondent: L.A. Vizsolyi Place and   Date of Hearing: Vancouver, British Columbia September 24, 2018 Place and   Date of Judgment: Vancouver, British Columbia January 11, 2019   Written Reasons by: The Honourable Mr. Justice Harris Concurred in by: The   Honourable Mr. Justice Savage The Honourable Madam Justice Fisher   Summary: Appeal of a sentence of 14 months’ incarceration imposed  after conviction for sexual interference with a four‑year‑old. Held:  appeal dismissed. Although the judge erred in his conclusion that the mandatory  minimum sentence imposed by s. 151 of the Criminal Code was  constitutional, he did not err in principle in concluding that on the facts of  this case a conditional sentence is not a fit sentence. No other error being  alleged, the Court defers to the sentence imposed by the judge. Reasons for Judgment of the Honourable Mr. Justice  Harris: [1]     This is a companion  case to  R. v. Scofield , indexed as 2019 BCCA 3, which  also engaged the constitutionality of the mandatory minimum sentence in  s. 151(a) of the  Criminal Code , R.S.C. 1985, c. C‑46. In   Scofield , this Court found, on the basis of a reasonable hypothetical  and the particularized inquiry as it applied to that case, that s. 151(a)  was unconstitutional and of no force or effect. [2]     While the  constitutional result applies in this case, the facts here are different to  those in  Scofield . [3]     In brief, Mr. Horswill  was convicted of sexual interference with a four‑year‑old girl, B.L.,  who was his family friends’ daughter. He was in his mid‑forties at the  time of the offence. On July 16, 2013, Mr. Horswill spent the day  with B.L.’s family at a lake. He chose to spend the night with B.L.’s family at  their cabin, and his wife returned home. B.L.’s father and Mr. Horswill  shared a bed. At some point during the night, Mr. Horswill got out of bed  and went to the bedroom shared by B.L. and her younger brother. He picked up B.L.  and took her downstairs to the bathroom where he removed her pajamas and diaper  and sat her on his lap. He put hand soap on his fingers and digitally  penetrated her vagina and anus. She testified that the experience was painful  and that she cried quietly so she would not wake her brother. Mr. Horswill  stopped when B.L. asked him to. He told her not to tell anyone or she would get  in trouble. He returned her to her bedroom. She told her parents what had  happened the next day. [4]     The judge sentenced Mr. Horswill  to 14 months’ imprisonment in addition to a term of probation and other  ancillary orders. [5]     On this appeal, Mr. Horswill  concedes that the length of the sentence falls within the applicable range and  does not challenge it on appeal. The focus of his appeal, so far as the non‑constitutional  issues are concerned, is that the judge erred in finding a conditional sentence  order (“CSO”) was not warranted, irrespective of its unavailability in face of  the mandatory minimum sentence. [6]     The essential facts  on which Mr. Horswill relies in support of his argument are: ·   Mr. Horswill  was born in Nelson, B.C., and has two brothers. ·   His  upbringing was stable and caring. ·   He has  been married for over 24 years. ·   He and  his wife have two children. ·   Mr. Horswill  and his wife have lived in the same community since 1996. ·   They  recently sold their home, partly to address the issue of not wanting to see the  complainant family. ·   Mr. Horswill  served in the Canadian Armed Forces after high school. ·   After  receiving an honourable discharge, he worked at C.P. Rail for two years and  attended Selkirk College in Nelson. ·   He  then took a job as an Application and Contract Sales Engineer for two years at  Modern Systems Management and then for five years at Entegrated Systems  Consultants Ltd. ·   He  relocated to his current community and started a company in 1996. He and his  wife became its sole owners in 2004. By 2005, the company employed 15‑20  people in the area. ·   In  2013, they sold the company but Mr. Horswill remained an employee until  January 2016 when convicted. He and his wife started another enterprise shortly  thereafter, which subcontracts to their former company. Currently, he works  mostly from home. ·   Mr. Horswill  is a pilot and frequently updates his training. ·   His  wife stated that the conviction has devastated the family but they have rallied  behind him. ·     Mr. Horswill  began attending counseling in February 2016 to address the stress in his life. [7]     In addition, Mr. Horswill  relies on letters from his family and friends reflecting his honesty,  integrity, good character, his commitment to his family (both close and  extended), and the devastating emotional and financial consequences for both  him and his family resulting from the conviction. [8]     As counsel wrote in  his statement on sentence: [13] …  Mr. Horswill presented as a well-liked, respected and stable citizen and  family man, and was an upstanding member of [his] community, with no prior  criminal record. It is fair to say that the conviction and sentence were  devastating to him, his business and his family. The trial judge acknowledged  that a prison term would be difficult for him. [Citations  omitted.] [9]     The judge addressed  the potential availability of a CSO in his reasons, indexed as  R. v. Horswill ,  2017 BCSC 35 (unreported): [58] Mr. Horswill,  in his submissions, relies upon the proposition that, but for the minimum  sentence provision, he would be permitted to serve his sentence by way of a  conditional sentence, and thus the mandatory minimum has the effect of  preventing him from being able to access a valid and effective alternative  sentence. [59] In  my respectful view, a conditional sentence is not a viable alternative to a traditional  in‑custody carceral sentence, notwithstanding that bar. This is not a sentence  which should which could be served in the community. While I am well aware of  the line of authority commencing with  R. v. Proulx , 2000 SCC 5  accepting that a conditional sentence order, properly fashioned, can, in many  situations, adequately meet the objectives of denunciation and deterrence, in  the facts of this case, I would not be prepared to accept that a conditional  sentence order could adequately serve those purposes of sentence in this case.  I note that the authorities quite resolutely indicate that conditional sentence  orders are not appropriate in offences of this nature, and also that at least  one other  Criminal Code  provision precludes the availability of a  conditional sentence in a matter of this nature: s. 742.1 (c)  prohibits the imposition of a conditional sentence where the offence, when prosecuted  by way of indictment, has a maximum term of imprisonment of fourteen years. [10]     The judge’s last statement  was a mistake because the offence did not have a maximum term of imprisonment  of 14 years. At the time of the offence, the maximum term was 10 years. [11]     Mr. Horswill  contends the judge erred in principle when he asserted the authorities “quite  resolutely indicate that conditional sentences are not appropriate for offences  of this nature”. He argues the judge wrongly treated this offence as a category  of offence for which a CSO is not available in principle. To the contrary,  conditional sentences have been imposed for offences of this nature when  considered appropriate in the right circumstances. [12]     I accept that there is no absolute and categorical rejection of the  availability of conditional sentences for offences such as sexual interference,  unless eliminated by operation of the  Code  itself. Whether such a  sentence is appropriate turns on the specific circumstances and whether, in all  of the circumstances of the case, the criteria established in  R. v. Proulx ,  2000 SCC 5, are met. Importantly, a CSO must be consistent with the  principles of sentencing, which, in a case of this kind, gives primacy to  denunciation and deterrence. [13]     Sentencing judges  are accorded significant deference absent an error in principle affecting the  sentence or the sentence being demonstrably unfit:  R. v. Agin ,  2018 BCCA 133 at para. 54. Considering whether a CSO was a fit sentence  formed part of the judge’s sentencing analysis. While the judge’s rejection of  a CSO appears in his reasons for judgment regarding the constitutional question  (indexed as 2017 BCSC 35) as opposed to the reasons for sentence (indexed as  2017 BCSC 160), his decision to reject a CSO forms part of his overall  determination of a fit sentence. Absent an error in principle, the sentencing  judge’s decision to reject a CSO is entitled to deference. [14]     In  R. v. Safaee ,  2009 BCCA 367, this Court rejected the availability of a CSO in a case  involving two incidents of sexual assault of a six‑year‑old. In the  words of Madam Justice Bennett: [21] The  child attended the daycare operated by the appellant’s wife. She had been  attending the daycare since she was one year old. The appellant occasionally  looked after the children when his wife was not at home, and on this occasion  his wife was in Iran. The child also stayed over at the appellant’s home when  her parents were out of town. The relationship was one of trust, and  significant trust.  [22] The  appellant has many factors operating in his favour. He is 51 years old and  has no criminal record. He pleaded guilty to the charge. He is an engineer by  training and works in the construction industry. He has suffered shame and has  shown remorse. He has been married for 26 years and has two sons, one in  high school and one in university. He had many letters of character reference  from members of the community. All of this evidence was carefully considered by  the sentencing judge. [23] The  effect of the offence on the victim and her family is severe. A Victim Impact  statement was filed and sets out the trauma experienced by the child and her  mother. [24] The  appellant’s rehabilitation may be achieved by taking a sex offender treatment  program while on a conditional sentence.  [25] However,  the principles of deterrence and denunciation will not be achieved by a  conditional sentence. This is an offence of a most serious breach of trust.  Parents who deliver their children to the care of other people are entitled to  be secure in the knowledge that their children are safe and will not be  sexually assaulted by those who are entrusted with their care. The moral  blameworthiness of the appellant is high. In  Proulx , the court stated at  para. 102. [102] Denunciation is the  communication of society’s condemnation of the offender’s conduct. In  M. (C.A.) ,   supra , at para. 81, I wrote; In  short, a sentence with a denunciatory element represents a symbolic, collective  statement that the offender’s conduct should be punished for encroaching on our  society’s basic code of values as enshrined within our substantive criminal  law. As Lord Justice Lawton stated in  R. v. Sargeant  (1974),  60 Cr. App R. 74, at p. 77: “society, through the courts, must  show its abhorrence of particular types of crime, and the only way in which the  courts can show this is by the sentence they pass”. Incarceration  will usually provide more denunciation than a conditional sentence, as a  conditional sentence is generally a more lenient sentence than a jail term of  equivalent duration. That said, a conditional sentence can still provide a significant  amount of denunciation. This is particularly so when onerous conditions are  imposed and the duration of the conditional sentence is extended beyond the  duration of the jail sentence that would ordinarily have been imposed in the  circumstances. I will discuss each point in turn. [26] Deterrence  and denunciation can be achieved in some cases by a conditional sentence order.  However, it would be the rare case where these principles are appropriately  addressed by a conditional sentence in a case involving sexual assaults  committed by a daycare operator on a vulnerable child. [15]     Safaee  does not categorically rule out  conditional sentences. It indicates that they will rarely be available in cases  of sexual assaults against vulnerable children involving significant breaches  of trust by an adult. As always, a principle stated in a case must be read in  light of the facts giving rise to it.  Safaee  makes clear that, for an  offence of this gravity, a CSO will likely be available only in exceptional circumstances.  Nonetheless, each case must be considered in light of all of the pertinent  circumstances. [16]     In this case, I do  not think the judge premised his reasoning on a categorical rejection of the  availability of a CSO. Rather, his conclusion was reached in the context of the  particular circumstances of the case. I read the critical parts of the impugned  reasoning as concluding that,  on these facts , a CSO is not available  because it will not satisfy the criteria established in  Proulx .  Moreover, his statement that courts resolutely conclude that a CSO is unavailable  for offences  of this nature  is a means of capturing the constellation of  circumstances that make this case similar to others in which conditional  sentences were unavailable. As such, his statement is consistent with and  captures the thrust of this Court’s reasoning in  Safaee . In substance,  the judge is explaining why, on the facts of this case (as with comparable  cases), a CSO is unavailable. [17]     As a result, I am  not persuaded that the judge erred in principle in rejecting a CSO. The judge  was aware of the relevant facts. No error is alleged in respect of his  appreciation of the evidence. In particular, the judge was alive to Mr. Horswill’s  personal circumstances including the challenges of a prison sentence.  [18]     The reasons  carefully analyzed the relevant sentencing principles involving sexual  interference with a young child. Those principles place primary weight on  denunciation and deterrence. The judge also examined the facts carefully. In  summarizing his reasoning, he said: [62] In  determining what would properly constitute a fit sentence for Mr. Horswill  in this situation, I must take into account that, while there was one incident  only, the assault upon this child was serious and invasive. The victim was  vulnerable in that she was only four years of age; she was sleeping in her own  bed in her own home when this occurred. [63] … I am  satisfied that there was an element of trust that must be ascribed to the  position in which Mr. Horswill found himself. While this was not the  classic situation of a caregiver to whom a child’s welfare had been  specifically entrusted, he was a trusted friend of the family and, on that  basis, had been welcomed into their home. It was in that circumstance that he  had access to this child. [64] Additionally,  I am satisfied that the offence has had a serious and harmful effect upon the  child, as well as on her parents, and the family dynamic. The long-term effects  for the child are not known at this time, but there is at least a reasonable  basis to be concerned that she may experience some repercussions. [65] As  for Mr. Horswill, I have to take into account that he is an individual who  has never before had any dealings with the criminal justice system. He has no  criminal record. He must be considered, for the purpose of this exercise, an  individual of good character. The many letters filed on his behalf attest to  that. [19]     The judge referred  to the many cases with which he had been provided before concluding that a fit  sentence for Mr. Horswill was in the range of 12 to 18 months: [74] The  sentence range I have set out takes into account the specific nature and  circumstances of the offence and the fact that Mr. Horswill is a  first-time offender of otherwise good character. It is informed by a  consideration of the other case decisions to which I have been referred and the  relevant  Criminal Code  provisions dealing with sentencing. [20]     Accepting the  gravity of the offence, there were no sufficiently exceptional circumstances to  justify a CSO. Even though Mr. Horswill is a person of good character,  there are no mitigating circumstances that would serve to reduce his moral  culpability to the degree necessary to make a CSO a reasonable sentence. As the  judge observed, there is no apparent explanation why Mr. Horswill  committed the offence. [21]     In the result, the  judge did not err in principle in rejecting the availability of a CSO on the  facts of this case. [22]     Mr. Horswill  does not argue the sentence is demonstrably unfit and he accepts that his 14‑month  sentence is within an acceptable range of sentences for this type of offence.  [23]     Accordingly, I would  dismiss the appeal. It is not necessary to engage with the judge’s reasoning on  the mandatory minimum sentence, since those issues are addressed in  Scofield .   “The Honourable Mr. Justice Harris” I  agree: “The Honourable Mr. Justice Savage” I  agree: “The  Honourable Madam Justice Fisher”"},"meta":{},"created_at":"2022-03-08T08:08:14.439247Z","updated_at":"2022-03-10T00:48:13.995144Z","project":2},{"id":36,"annotations":[{"id":42,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"start":3,"end":40,"text":"THE SUPREME COURT OF BRITISH COLUMBIA","labels":["COURT_NAME"]},"id":"3e227ed0-9","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":125,"end":140,"text":"Victoria Regina","labels":["PERS_APPELLANT"]},"id":"3e227f0c-9","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":144,"end":158,"text":"David  Huntley","labels":["PERS_RESPONDENT"]},"id":"3e227f3e-9","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":168,"end":203,"text":"The Honourable Mr. Justice Thompson","labels":["PERS_JUDGE"]},"id":"3e227f84-9","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":262,"end":272,"text":"M.

Huntley,   2021 BCSC 149 Date: 20210106 Docket: 175901-2 Registry:  Victoria Regina v. David  Huntley Before:  The Honourable Mr. Justice Thompson Oral Ruling on  Charter  Voir Dire Counsel for the Crown: M. Halston Counsel for the Accused: M. Munro Place and Date of Hearing: Victoria, B.C. January 4-6, 2021 Place and Date of Judgment: Victoria, B.C. January 6, 2021   [1]     THE COURT:  Mr. Huntley is charged with possession of  heroin, fentanyl, and cocaine for the purpose of trafficking. This was a downtown  Victoria street arrest. A search incident to the arrest turned up the  controlled substances that are the subject of the charges. [2]     Constable Ewington is a Victoria City Police officer. He was on foot  patrol. He observed what he suspected to be a hand-to-hand drug transaction. He  and his partner of the day, Constable Tremblay, followed one of the persons who  engaged in this behaviour (later identified as Mr. Huntley) for two or  three blocks. The police officers then stopped Mr. Huntley for jaywalking.   [3]     During this detention, Cst. Ewington testified that he observed part of  a cylindrical tube in Mr. Huntley's rear pocket, and concluded that it was  pepper spray. He arrested Mr. Huntley for possession of a weapon. During  the search conducted incident to the weapon arrest, the tube was examined. It was,  in fact, an M&M candy container taped up. The controlled substances were in  this container. Mr. Huntley was then arrested for possession of controlled  substances. He was also issued a ticket for disobeying a pedestrian control  signal under s. 132(3) of the  Motor Vehicle Act . [4]     Counsel for Mr. Huntley filed a  Charter  notice. Mr. Huntley  argues that his detention for disobeying a pedestrian control signal was a ruse  in furtherance of a drug investigation. He argues that his detention was  unlawful and the searches that occurred during his detention were unreasonable.  He contends that the police infringed his rights under ss. 7, 8, and 9 of  the  Charter . If an infringement is found, Mr. Huntley will apply  under s. 24(2) to exclude from evidence the items seized during his  detention. [5]     Mr. Halston, during argument for the Crown, ably and concisely  summarized the law applicable to this type of case. If a detention has more  than one real purpose, multiple purposes may coexist without infringing  s. 9 of the  Charter :  R. v. Kaddoura , 2009 BCCA 113 at paras. 23-24;   R. v. Madill , 2005 BCSC 1564 at para. 26. On the other hand, it is  settled that the police cannot employ a lawful aim as a pretext to perpetuate  an unlawful aim:  R. v. Nolet , 2010 SCC 24 at para. 36. See also  R.  v. Dudhi , 2019 ONCA 665 at para. 91. The police cannot misuse their  enforcement powers under the  Motor Vehicle Act  in furtherance of a  criminal investigation:  R. v. Woody , 2018 BCSC 2275 at para. 40. [6]     The issue in this case comes down to one of fact. What was in Cst.  Ewington's mind when he first detained Mr. Huntley? For the reasons that  follow, I conclude that what Cst. Ewington had in mind was using the jaywalking  infraction as a pretext to detain Mr. Huntley so as to further the drug  investigation. Contrary to Cst. Ewington's evidence, I find that this was the  sole purpose of the detention. [7]     Cst. Ewington had about four years’ of policing experience at the time  of the alleged offence, but when he was with the RCMP in Fort St. John for  three years he spent some of this time on a unit dedicated to investigating low-level  to mid-level drug trafficking activity. He testified that he had been involved  in hundreds of drug investigations before 1 April 2019, the date of the alleged  offences. Cst. Ewington was partnered with Cst. Tremblay, a police officer with  about 20 months' experience at that time. Cst. Tremblay had only a small amount  of experience investigating drug offences. The two police officers were doing  an overtime shift and were not regular partners. They had rarely, if ever,  worked together before. [8]     Their shift on 1 April 2019 started at 10:00 a.m. They were in uniform,  assigned to patrol the area around 900 block Pandora Avenue in downtown  Victoria. There is a homeless shelter and a safe injection site on that block. It  is an area where drug offences are frequently observed. At about 11:00 a.m.,  the two police officers were side by side as they approached the gated  courtyard area outside the homeless shelter and there were about 30 or 40  people congregated in that area. Mr. Huntley was in one group.  [9]     As the police officers entered the courtyard, Cst. Ewington testified he  saw a suspicious hand contact between Mr. Huntley and another man. Although  he did not see any items passed, the hands moving from pocket to contact, at  this location notorious for such transactions, caused Cst. Ewington to infer  that a drug transaction may have taken place. Neither participant in this  hand-to-hand contact were known to Cst. Ewington. Cst. Tremblay did not see  what Cst. Ewington described.  [10]     Someone in the courtyard said, \"Six up,\" a phrase warning  others that police were nearby. Mr. Huntley promptly left the courtyard. The  two police -- Mr. Huntley, you might want to stay awake for this. [11]     THE ACCUSED: I was listening. [12]     THE COURT: The two police officers had a brief conversation. Cst.  Tremblay told Cst. Ewington that the person who Mr. Huntley was in contact  with was Dustin McPhail. Cst. Tremblay told Cst. Ewington that he knew Mr. McPhail  as a person involved in the drug trade. Cst. Tremblay testified, and I accept,  that this was a \"quick little conversation\" that \"came to a  determination to follow Mr. Huntley [i.e. the person who was later  identified as Mr. Huntley] and see what happens.\" Cst. Tremblay  perceived that Cst. Ewington's plan was to catch up to Mr. Huntley and  stop him. [13]     Cst. Ewington testified that while at 919 Pandora Avenue he had formed  the grounds and the intention to arrest Mr. Huntley. He testified that it  was prudent for safety reasons to let Mr. Huntley separate himself from  the hundred or so people hanging around in the courtyard and outside of that  address before conducting the arrest. I accept that this plan to avoid an  arrest at that location would be very sensible, but, for reasons that I will come  to, I do not accept Cst. Ewington's evidence that he had formed grounds or the  intention to arrest Mr. Huntley at that point in time. [14]     The two police officers followed Mr. Huntley westbound on the south  side of Pandora Avenue. Mr. Huntley was walking but at a brisk pace. It is  a considerable distance to the end of this long city block, i.e. the 900 block  of Pandora Avenue, to the intersection with Quadra Street. Mr. Huntley then  crossed Quadra Street and continued westbound. The next block on Pandora Avenue  is also a very long one.  [15]     Based on Cst. Tremblay's evidence, I conclude that the police were  following Mr. Huntley at a distance of about 20 yards. While they were  following Mr. Huntley, Cst. Tremblay testified that nothing further was  said about the plan in relation to Mr. Huntley. Cst. Ewington was clearly  taking the lead and Cst. Tremblay assumed that Cst. Ewington's intention was to  stop Mr. Huntley at some point. While walking along, the police officers had  Mr. Huntley in sight. Cst. Tremblay was watching to see if Mr. Huntley  would do a shoulder check, or answer his phone, or try to dispose of anything. Apparently  no such behaviour was observed. [16]     Mr. Huntley walked along the entire length of the 800 block of  Pandora Avenue. I find that he crossed Blanshard Street at the end of that block  before turning left, that is, south. He walked the length of that block, too,  although it is a city block of a more usual length in downtown Victoria. By  this time, Cst. Tremblay estimated that the police were about a quarter-block  behind Mr. Huntley.  [17]     The police officers saw Mr. Huntley cross Johnson Street, in the  crosswalk. Johnson Street is at the end of that southbound block on Blanshard  Street. I accept Cst. Tremblay's evidence that Mr. Huntley crossed after  the pedestrian signal had turned from \"Walk\" to an indication not to  walk. The numbers were counting down to the time when the light for the  north-south traffic on Blanshard Street would turn amber.  [18]     On the basis of Cst. Tremblay's evidence I find that Cst. Ewington then said  to Cst. Tremblay, \"Okay, let's stop him now.\" Cst. Tremblay  testified that it was his impression that they were going to arrest Mr. Huntley  for what Cst. Ewington had observed back at 919 Pandora Avenue. I pause to say  that it is what was in Cst. Ewington's mind that matters, not what Cst. Tremblay  might have assumed that Cst. Ewington planned. [19]     The police officers quickened their pace to a light jog to catch up to Mr. Huntley,  and Cst. Ewington said to Mr. Huntley, \"Hey, it's Victoria Police,  just hang out there for a sec.\" Once Mr. Huntley stopped, and this  was partway down the next block on Blanshard Street heading southbound toward  Yates Street, Cst. Ewington said to Mr. Huntley, \"Hey, you just  jaywalked  — t hat's the  reason we're stopping you right now.\" Cst. Ewington asked Mr. Huntley  for identification and the events I recounted earlier in the introduction to  these reasons unfolded from there. [20]     As I said a moment ago, it is Cst. Ewington's intention as he effected  the detention that matters. He was taking the lead throughout, and Cst.  Tremblay, as he testified, was taking his cues from Cst. Ewington. My  assessment of the evidence, considered in the round, is that Cst. Ewington had  not decided to arrest for a  CDSA  offence when the police officers began  following Mr. Huntley. I think Cst. Ewington was suspicious, but had not  —  contrary to his evidence  —  concluded while at 919 Pandora Avenue  that Mr. Huntley was arrestable. As a police officer with some significant  drug investigation experience, I think Cst. Ewington knew that his observations  at 919 Pandora Avenue were thin and arguably insufficient grounds for a  CDSA   arrest. While he saw the suspicious conduct at a location with frequent drug  activity, and Cst. Ewington was told that Mr. McPhail was known to have  some involvement in the drug trade, it was a single hand-to-hand observation  with no items seen. I conclude that Cst. Ewington made the sensible decision to  follow Mr. Huntley and to observe him. I think he also had in mind  stopping Mr. Huntley to see if further evidence might be obtained.  [21]     I come to this conclusion after considering the surrounding  probabilities. I begin with the absence of reference in Cst. Ewington’s report  to Crown Counsel to a decision to arrest being made while Cst. Ewington was at  919 Pandora Avenue. The narrative in this report authored by Cst. Ewington  gives no indication of this early subjective formation of grounds to arrest. [22]     My conclusion is also consistent with the actions of Cst. Ewington taken  with Cst. Tremblay in his wake. They followed Mr. Huntley for a  considerable distance without getting too close. Cst. Tremblay's evidence is  that they were still a quarter-block behind Mr. Huntley when he jaywalked.  During this walk, the police officers were following and observing, but taking  no steps to arrest Mr. Huntley despite soon being well away from the crowd  in the 900 block of Pandora Avenue. I am satisfied that the reason no steps  were taken to arrest was because Cst. Ewington had not formed the intention to  arrest while at 919 Pandora Avenue, or since they had left 919 Pandora Avenue.  They had seen nothing during the walk that had added anything to the evidence  against Mr. Huntley. [23]     My conclusion is also consistent with Cst. Tremblay's evidence that the  two officers had a \"quick little conversation\" and \"came to a  determination to follow Mr. Huntley and see what happens.\" The  notion of \"see[ing] what happens\" captures the essence of what Cst.  Ewington's intentions were  —  as  opposed to a settled intention to pursue and arrest Mr. Huntley.  [24]     I conclude that Cst. Ewington's evidence is an inaccurate reconstruction  of what was in his mind during the time from when Mr. Huntley came to his  attention to the time that Cst. Ewington saw what he thought was a canister of  pepper spray. I find that Cst. Ewington's decision to stop Mr. Huntley for  crossing Johnson Street when the pedestrian countdown had already begun was reflected  in what he said to Cst. Tremblay: \"Okay, let's stop him now.\" This  stop was a pretext to try to gather more evidence in the midst of a  CDSA   investigation. [25]     This was not a dual-purpose stop like occurred in the  Kaddoura   case. I find that there was only one real reason for stopping Mr. Huntley.  The purpose of the stop was to attempt to secure further evidence in support of  the  CDSA  charge. In making this finding, I appreciate that Cst. Ewington  made reference to a \"dual purpose\" during cross-examination, but I  find that this was a reconstruction. Notably, this is not reflected by what he  said in his report to Crown Counsel where he asserts (contrary to my finding)  that the reason for the detention was an observed  Motor Vehicle Act   infraction.  [26]     I do not accept Cst. Ewington's evidence that grounds were formed while  at 919 Pandora Avenue and that one of the reasons for stopping Mr. Huntley  was to arrest him for a  CDSA  offence. I appreciate that this is what  Cst. Tremblay may have assumed would happen, but I find that the real reason  for the stop was to \"see what happens\" during a pretext stop. If one  of the reasons for stopping Mr. Huntley was, in fact, to arrest him for a  CDSA   offence, I think it highly likely that a drug investigator with some  experience like Cst. Ewington would have advised Mr. Huntley immediately  of the reason for his arrest as Cst. Ewington surely knew he was obliged to do  under s. 10(a) of the  Charter . [27]     In conclusion, the jaywalking stop was a pretext. In the event, it was a  productive ruse that resulted in the gathering of critical evidence in the drug  investigation. There is no doubt that the jaywalking stop was a detention, and  it was an unlawful detention because of the misuse of a lawful power as a  pretext to further the criminal investigation. The detention was therefore  arbitrary and an infringement of s. 9 of the  Charter . It follows  that searches conducted subsequent to the arbitrary detention were unreasonable  and infringed s. 8 of the  Charter .  “Thompson  J.”"},"meta":{},"created_at":"2022-03-08T08:08:14.439084Z","updated_at":"2022-03-10T00:44:59.846801Z","project":2},{"id":35,"annotations":[{"id":41,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"start":3,"end":40,"text":"THE SUPREME COURT OF BRITISH COLUMBIA","labels":["COURT_NAME"]},"id":"3e228e7a-9","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":132,"end":138,"text":"Regina","labels":["PERS_APPELLANT"]},"id":"3e228eac-9","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":142,"end":155,"text":"Kyle  Latimer","labels":["PERS_RESPONDENT"]},"id":"3e228ede-9","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":157,"end":170,"text":"Craig Latimer","labels":["PERS_RESPONDENT"]},"id":"3e228f06-9","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":172,"end":185,"text":"Jacob Pereira","labels":["PERS_RESPONDENT"]},"id":"3e228f38-9","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":186,"end":203,"text":" Anduele Pikiento","labels":["PERS_RESPONDENT"]},"id":"3e228f60-9","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":205,"end":218,"text":"Csongor Szucs","labels":["PERS_RESPONDENT"]},"id":"3e228fb0-9","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":304,"end":336,"text":"s.  648(1) of the  Criminal Code","labels":["SECTION"]},"id":"3e228fe2-9","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":570,"end":602,"text":"The Honourable Madam Justice Ker","labels":["PERS_JUDGE"]},"id":"3e229028-9","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":706,"end":714,"text":"M.

January 15, 2020     [1]     THE COURT:  This is an oral ruling subject to editing for grammar  and style if it is transcribed. The result will not change. [2]     The Court is embarked upon  voir dire  #4—which is Application #21—a  defence challenge to the lawfulness of the accused Csongor Szucs' arrest on  June 19, 2017. The defence has tendered Exhibit A for identification on  the  voir dire , a CD that contains two folders. The Crown objects to the  admissibility of the contents of the first folder, entitled \"App.21.Videos\".   [3]     In that folder are three video clips with file names 00071.wmv (“Video  Clip 71”), 00307.wmv (“Video Clip 307”), and 00310.avi (“Video Clip 310”). All  video clips are from June 19, 2017. Video Clip 307 and Video Clip 310 are from  CCTV surveillance footage of the lobby and elevator bank at the Fairmont  Pacific Rim Estates, a residential building on West Cordova Street in  Vancouver, BC. Video Clip 71 is video footage taken by a member of the  Vancouver Police Department (“VPD”) surveillance team who was part of a team following  the movements of a male believed to be Jacob Pereira, one of Mr. Szucs'  co-accused on this indictment. Video Clip 71 appears to depict Mr. Pereira and  Mr. Szucs leaving the Fairmont Pacific Rim Hotel, which is connected to the Fairmont  Pacific Rim Estates, approximately eight minutes after Mr. Pereira can be seen  waiting to travel up the elevator inside the Fairmont Pacific Rim Estates. [4]     All three video clips depict a man who appears to Jacob Pereira wearing  a red leather jacket and carrying a beige coloured backpack. The time of the  three video clips is between 14:02 hours and 14:13 hours on June 19, 2017.  [5]     The backpack figures in this  voir dire  as it is the backpack that  VPD surveillance members observed being placed by Mr. Pereira into a black  Dodge Durango that Mr. Szucs was driving that day. That vehicle was pulled over  later on in the afternoon of June 19, 2017, by a member of the Hope, BC RCMP at  the request and direction of the VPD. [6]     The Crown objects to the admission of these three video clips on the  basis of relevance. The Crown argues that because the issue on this  voir  dire  is whether Detective Constable Hill had reasonable grounds to arrest Mr.  Szucs and because Detective Constable Hill had not seen the video clips before  Mr. Szucs' arrest and they did not form the basis for his subjective grounds,  the video clips are irrelevant and ought not to be admitted.  [7]     The Crown advanced two other bases for the objection, but at the end of  argument, the Crown acknowledged that   the real basis for objecting to  the admissibility is relevance. Accordingly, I will only address the relevance  ground. [8]     The defence asserts the video clips are relevant to assist the Court in  determining the objective reasonableness of Detective Constable Hill's subjective  grounds. One of Detective Constable Hill’s grounds was that he had been advised  by a VPD surveillance team member that the backpack that the man believed to be  Jacob Pereira was carrying that afternoon appeared to be \"distinctly  heavier\" after he was seen exiting a vehicle driven by Gurvinder Randhawa  at approximately 13:48 hours at Nelson and Richards Street in Vancouver, BC. Mr.  Pereira and Mr. Randhawa had a one-minute meeting in Mr. Randhawa's  Ford Fusion. When Mr. Pereira left the Ford Fusion, surveillance members  described the backpack, as related in the master surveillance reports, as  looking \"distinctly heavier\", \"very heavy\", and that \"[t]he  bag was also being pushed out by the contents and was close to full by the  volume of the contents.\" [9]     Detective Constable Hill believes Mr. Randhawa gave Mr. Pereira drugs at  this meeting and that the drugs were from #907-1221 Bidwell Street in Vancouver,  BC—a location he believed was a stash site for the Kang group's drug trafficking  enterprise. Mr. Randhawa was believed to be one of the drug couriers for the  Kang group. Mr. Pereira was believed to be a member of the Red Scorpion group  and a close associate of Kyle Latimer, another co-accused on this indictment. On  the basis of the observations relayed and the believed associations, Detective  Constable Hill formed the belief that the drugs were exchanged between  Mr. Randhawa and Mr. Pereira and that Mr. Pereira had the drugs in  the beige backpack that was later put into the Dodge Durango driven by Mr. Szucs. [10]     After Mr. Pereira left Mr. Randhawa's Ford Fusion, he went to a Mercedes  vehicle registered in his name, put the backpack in the vehicle, and drove to  the Fairmont Pacific Rim Hotel, arriving 10 minutes later at 14:01 hours.  [11]     Video Clips 307 and 310, which are from the Fairmont Pacific Rim Estates,  depict Mr. Pereira with a beige backpack slung across one shoulder as he  strides through the lobby and with both straps of the backpack over his  shoulders as he waits at the elevator. A good view of that backpack can be seen  at approximately the 11-second mark of Video Clip 310 when Mr. Pereira is in  profile to the CCTV camera and the dimensions of the backpack are readily  apparent. A similar view of the backpack can be seen on Video Clip 71 at  approximately the 20-second mark. [12]     In cross-examination, Detective Constable Hill was unable to offer  comments about the heaviness of the backpack from Video Clip 310, but he did  say that in Video Clips 307 and 71, the backpack did not look that heavy. [13]     Defence seeks to have the videos admitted not to challenge Detective  Constable Hill's subjective grounds with respect to the arrest of Mr. Szucs but  to assist in determining the objective reasonableness of those grounds in so  far as the “heaviness” of the backpack is concerned after the meeting between  Mr. Randhawa and Mr. Pereira in the Ford Fusion at 13:48 hours.  [14]     The defence acknowledges that Detective Constable Hill did not see the video  clips at the time they were taken, and they did not form part of his grounds  for arrest. What did form part of his grounds was the surveillance team's  comments about the change in the weight and appearance of the bag after Mr.  Pereira concluded his meeting with Mr. Randhawa.  [15]     The defence argument appears to suggest that the video clips are  objective evidence about the actual state of the backpack that Mr. Pereira had  after his meeting with Mr. Randhawa and that an examination of the video clips  establishes that the backpack was not as described in the master surveillance  reports. The defence argues that this goes to the objective reasonableness of  Detective Constable Hill's grounds. [16]     In order for an arrest under s. 495(1)(a) of the  Criminal Code,  R.S.C.  1985 c. C-46 to be lawful, the arresting officer must subjectively believe  that there are reasonable grounds and those grounds must be objectively  justifiable:  R. v. Storrey , [1990] 1 S.C.R. 241 at 250–251 as cited in  R.  v. Jir , 2010 BCCA 497 at para. 18 and  R. v. Luong , 2017 BCSC 1779 at  para. 46.  [17]     In  Luong  at paras. 50 and 51, Mr. Justice Bowden succinctly  summarized the concept of reasonable grounds and the objective standard: [50] As  cited in  Jir , in  R. v. Luong , 2010 BCCA 158, Madam Justice  Bennett stated: [24] The  assessment of whether objective grounds exist undertaken by a trial judge is  conducted by first looking at the observations of the officer (which the trial  judge has found as facts) through the lens of someone who has the same  experience, training, knowledge and skills as the officer who is making the  observations, and then deciding if a reasonable person with the same lens would  come to the same conclusion as the police officer… [51] The reasonable grounds standard  is less than the civil standard of proof and is one of reasonable probability  or reasonable belief. ( R. v. Debot , [1989] 2 S.C.R. 1140 and  Jir ).  It requires something more than mere suspicion that amounts to “…a practical,  non-technical and common sense probability as to the existence of the facts and  inferences asserted.” ( Mugesera v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and  Immigration) , 2005 SCC 40 at para. 141 and  R. v. Sanchez , (1994), 93  C.C.C. (3d) 357 at page 367, as referred to in  Jir ). [18]     The Crown asserts that because objective reasonableness or the objective  standard is assessed from the perspective of a reasonable person standing in  the shoes of Detective Constable Hill and Detective Constable Hill did not see  the videos at the time he formed his grounds, the videos are irrelevant to the  assessment of the grounds on the objective standard. [19]     I must, with respect, disagree. While I understand the point the Crown  makes, what is troubling in all of this is the fact that the videos of the  backpack do not show a heavy backpack or a backpack “pushed out by the contents”  and “close to full by volume of the contents”.  [20]     In my view, where one officer is forming the grounds for arrest and is  relying upon the observations of the surveillance team, then the reporting of  the observations ought to be accurate. The video clips in Exhibit A might tend  to contradict the accuracy of the observations noted in the master surveillance  report as the observations were related to Detective Constable Hill by members  of the surveillance team at the time.  [21]     To that extent, in my view, the video clips are relevant. The weight to  be attached to the video clips may well be another matter. However, they appear  to be relevant and therefore are admissible for that purpose on the  voir  dire . “Ker J.”"},"meta":{},"created_at":"2022-03-08T08:08:14.438944Z","updated_at":"2022-03-10T00:39:17.217362Z","project":2},{"id":33,"annotations":[{"id":39,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"start":0,"end":36,"text":"COURT OF APPEAL FOR BRITISH COLUMBIA","labels":["COURT_NAME"]},"id":"3e229e9c-9","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":114,"end":120,"text":"Regina","labels":["PERS_RESPONDENT"]},"id":"3e229ece-9","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":136,"end":140,"text":"N.P.","labels":["PERS_APPELLANT"]},"id":"3e229f14-9","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":236,"end":281,"text":"s. 110(1)  of the  Youth Criminal Justice Act","labels":["SECTION"]},"id":"3e229f46-9","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":453,"end":498,"text":"s. 111(1) of the   Youth Criminal Justice Act","labels":["SECTION"]},"id":"3e229f6e-9","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":722,"end":743,"text":"ss. 110(3) and 111(2)","labels":["SECTION"]},"id":"3e229fa0-9","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":841,"end":871,"text":"s. 486.4 of the  Criminal Code","labels":["SECTION"]},"id":"3e229fd2-9","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":11994,"end":12011,"text":"s. 686(1)(b)(iii)","labels":["SECTION"]},"id":"3e22a018-9","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":1075,"end":1111,"text":"The Honourable Madam Justice Newbury","labels":["PERS_JUDGE"]},"id":"3e22a05e-9","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":2293,"end":2305,"text":"NEWBURY J.A.","labels":["PERS_JUDGE"]},"id":"3e22a090-9","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":12566,"end":12603,"text":"The  Honourable Madam Justice Newbury","labels":["PERS_JUDGE"]},"id":"3e22a0b8-9","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":1112,"end":1145,"text":"The Honourable Mr. Justice Hunter","labels":["PERS_JUDGE"]},"id":"3e22a0ea-9","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":12510,"end":12521,"text":"HUNTER J.A.","labels":["PERS_JUDGE"]},"id":"3e22a112-9","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":1146,"end":1179,"text":"The Honourable Mr. Justice Grauer","labels":["PERS_JUDGE"]},"id":"3e22a144-9","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":12542,"end":12553,"text":"GRAUER J.A.","labels":["PERS_JUDGE"]},"id":"3e22a176-9","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":1393,"end":1404,"text":"J.L.

Before: The Honourable Madam Justice Newbury The Honourable Mr. Justice Hunter The Honourable Mr. Justice Grauer On appeal from: An  order of the Provincial Court of British Columbia, dated    March 28, 2019 ( R. v. [N.P.] , Cranbrook Docket 3834-1). Oral Reasons for Judgment Counsel for the Appellant (via videoconference): J.L. Martin Counsel for the Respondent (via videoconference): N.G. Melling Place and Date of Hearing: Vancouver, British   Columbia January 14, 2021 Place and Date of Judgment: Vancouver, British   Columbia January 14, 2021   Summary: The appellant, N.P., was  convicted of sexual assault of his stepsister. N.P. submitted, and the Crown  conceded, that the judge erred by admitting Facebook messages between the complainant  and her father following the alleged assault as consistent statements which  reflected positively on her credibility. Held: Appeal allowed and new trial  ordered. The prior consistent statements of the complainant should not have  been entered into evidence or considered by the trial judge in assessing her  credibility or corroborating her testimony. Prior consistent statements are  presumptively inadmissible and no exception to this rule applied in this case.  [1]     NEWBURY J.A. : The Crown has conceded that this appeal should be  allowed and a new trial ordered, and I agree with that disposition.  [2]     Mr. P was convicted of the sexual assault of B.M. At the time, he  was 15 years old. B.M. was his stepsister and was then age 16. B.M.  testified that at about 1:00 a.m. on July 24, 2018, the appellant and  B.M. were staying at the home of her paternal grandparents. Apparently they  were expected to sleep on the same couch. The two were at opposite ends of a  sectional; she was positioned on one end of the couch with her feet towards him  at the other end. She testified at trial that he began to rub her legs with his  hand. When she moved her legs away, he tried to “touch her and [run] his hand  up her leg.” (Reasons at para. 3.) He then crawled on top of her and  grabbed her breasts. She responded by repeatedly saying ‘no’ and told him to  stop. He said, “Then blow me and I’ll leave you alone.” When she refused, he  again grabbed her breasts and as she tried to move away, grabbed her by the  hips and pulled her back onto the couch. She testified that he pulled her  pyjama pants to her knees and inserted his penis into her vagina.  [3]     The appellant testified in his defence, agreeing with virtually all of  the foregoing, except that he denied touching B.M. sexually or at all.  [4]     The Crown entered into evidence a series of Instagram messages between  the appellant and B.M. In one these exchanges, which took place two months  before   the alleged offence, B.M. told Mr. P it was “wack” — i.e., absurd — for  him to try to “smash” her — i.e., have sex with her — given that he was her (half)  brother. His reply was, “Of course I am I’m 15 and your [sic] sexy.” In his  testimony, the appellant explained these messages as being simply “stupid” and  the result of his being drunk at the time. [5]     The Crown also sought to adduce into evidence some Facebook messages  between B.M. and her father  later in the morning of July 24, 2018 ,  in which she complained of what had happened, in a manner that was, in the  trial judge’s words, “consistent with what she testified to.” (At para. 16.)  Details of these messages are set forth at para. 21 of the appellant’s  factum.  [6]     In an exchange with Crown counsel, the trial judge suggested that B.M.’s  “prior consistent statements”, while not admissible for the truth of their  contents, were  admissible and could be used in assessing her credibility ,  on either the second or third branch of  R. v .  W.D.  [1991] 1  S.C.R. 742. Defence counsel agreed that the Facebook messages could be  used to assess credibility, “to the extent that it rebuts any sort of  suggestion of a ... recent fabrication.” He continued, “I could concede that,  to the extent that she hasn’t made up some story later on. I would submit that  it would be — should be assessed for that limited purpose ....” In fact, there  was no evidence that would have supported recent fabrication by B.M. of her  evidence.  [7]     No  voir dire  was held to determine the admissibility of the  consistent statements from Facebook.  [8]     At para. 5 of his reasons, the trial judge correctly stated the  three prongs of  R. v. W.D . On the first branch, he said he did not  believe the appellant’s denial of sexual contact and characterized Mr. P’s  explanation of the Instagram messages as “not compelling”. With respect to the  second branch of  W.D. , the judge found that the appellant’s evidence did  not raise a doubt, and that: He acknowledges in his evidence  that in sending an eggplant emoji and referring to “licked” he was asking B.M.  to perform a blowjob, that is to say, fellatio. It is consistent with B.M.’s evidence  that on the couch he asked her to “blow” him. [At para. 13.] [9]     Turning next to the third branch of  W.D. , the judge said this: ... I turn to consider the balance of the evidence. I found  the evidence of B.M. to be credible and compelling. Indeed, with respect to the  surrounding facts, including opportunity, it was confirmed by [Mr. P]. Furthermore, the Instagram exchange between them, and to  which I have already referred, is consistent with what she alleges occurred  later in this assault. Other than [Mr. P]’s denial being put to her, she  was not challenged or inconsistent in any way. Lastly, in Exhibit 1, pages 2 to 7, the Facebook messages  between B.M. and her father later in the morning on July 24, 2018, she  complained to her father of what occurred, which was again consistent with what  she testified to.  While those   Facebook messages from her are  not proof of what occurred, they are consistent with her evidence and reflect  positively on her credibility . In conclusion, I accept the  evidence of B.M. that she was assaulted by [Mr. P] just as she described.  [At paras. 14–7; emphasis added.]  [10]     In the result, the appellant was found guilty as charged. [11]     Statements consistent with a witness’s evidence are normally regarded as  self‑serving evidence and are presumptively inadmissible because they (i) lack  probative value and (ii) constitute hearsay when adduced for the truth of  their contents: see  R. v. Stirling  2008 SCC 10 at para. 5;   R. v. Dinardo  2008 SCC 24 at para. 36;  R. v. Ellard   2009 SCC 27 at para. 27;  R. v. M (E-H)  2015 BCCA 54 at para. 46;  and more recently,  R. v. Gill  2018 BCCA 275 at para. 65. As  S.N. Lederman, A.W. Bryant and M.K. Fuerst observe in  The Law  of Evidence in Canada  (5 th  ed., 2018) at §7.3, in addition  to the lack of probative value of such evidence, the most common rationale for  the rule is the risk of fabrication: no one should be allowed to create  evidence for him or herself. An exception historically existed in sexual  assault cases for “recent complaints” made by complainants soon after the  incident complained of, but that exception was abrogated by an amendment to the   Criminal Code  in 1983. (See now s. 275.)  [12]     There are several other exceptions to the rule but, in my view, none of  them is remotely applicable to this case. I have already mentioned that no  imputation of recent fabrication arises. The Crown suggested in its factum that  the exception known as “narrative as circumstantial evidence” — where out‑of‑court  statements made by a complainant in a sexual assault case may be used for the  “limited purpose of helping the trier of fact to understand how the complainant’s  story was initially disclosed” ( Dinardo  at para. 37) — might have  application, but I cannot agree. Cases in which it has applied have generally  involved witnesses who because of age, infirmity or similar circumstances are  unable to testify or have a particular difficulty beyond their control, in  testifying. In  Dinardo  itself, the complainant was young person with a  disability. In  R. v. G.C.  [2006] O.J. No. 2245 (C.A.), the  complainant was 8 years old. The Supreme Court in  Dinardo  approved  the reasoning of the majority in  G.C.  that her prior consistent  statements could be admitted, emphasizing at para. 39 that she had had  difficulty in situating events in time, was easily confused, and lied on occasion.   [13]     At the same time, the Supreme Court in  Dinardo  approved the Court  of Appeal’s conclusion in  G.C . that the trial judge had  erred  in  admitting the  content  of the complainant’s prior consistent statements  to  corroborate  her testimony at trial. Both courts cited with approval the  observation of the Ontario Court of Appeal in  R. v. F.(J.E.)  (1993) 85  C.C.C. (3d) 457 that:  The  fact  that the statements were made  is admissible to assist the jury as to the  sequence of events from the alleged offence to the prosecution so that they can  understand the conduct of the complainant and assess her truthfulness. However,  the jury must be instructed that they are not to look to the  content  of  the statement as proof that a crime has been committed. [At 476; emphasis  added.]  [14]     Very recently, in  R. v. Langan  2020 SCC 33, the Supreme  Court adopted the reasons of Chief Justice Bauman, dissenting, reported at 2019  BCCA 467. The Chief Justice quoted with approval passages from  Gill,   including this:  The prior consistent statement  is  not admitted for the truth of its contents or as a form of self-corroboration  of the trial testimony of the witness . The trier of fact also must not rely  on the statement to support the prohibited inference that repetition enhances  truthfulness. Rather, “the probative value of the statement lies in the  inferences that can be drawn from the timing and circumstances of the  statement,  rather than the simple fact that the [witness] has said the same  thing before ” . . . [At para. 91; emphasis added.] [15]     The situations in which the “narrative” exception may be relied upon,  then, are limited, and in any event such statements are not to be used for a  hearsay purpose — i.e., as a “form of self-corroboration”. ( Gill  at para. 76.)  No difficulty like that encountered in  Dinardo  or  G.C.  arose with  respect to the complainant’s testimony in the case at bar; nor was it contended  that the  timing or fact  of her complaint was of “independent cogency” in  assessing that testimony. It follows in my opinion that the prior consistent  statements of B.M. should not have been entered into evidence or considered by  the trial judge in assessing her credibility or corroborating her testimony. The  only relevance these statements could have had was to support the “prohibited  inference that repetition enhances truthfulness.” ( Gill  at para. 76.) [16]     I also agree with the Crown that the curative proviso in s. 686(1)(b)(iii)  cannot properly be applied in this case. As Mr. Melling acknowledged, it  cannot safely be said that defence counsel made a tactical decision not to  object; and the trial judge gave sufficient importance to the Facebook evidence  to suggest that it did figure significantly in his reasoning.  [17]     In the result, I am satisfied that we have no choice but to allow the  appeal, and order that the case be remitted for retrial.  [18]     I thank counsel for their helpful submissions.

Before: The Honourable Madam Justice Saunders The Honourable Mr. Justice Fitch The Honourable Mr. Justice Grauer On appeal from: An  order of the Supreme Court of British Columbia, dated    December 12, 2018 (conviction) ( R. v. Veeken ,  2018 BCSC 2429,    Prince George Docket 37730‑2). Oral Reasons for Judgment Counsel for the Appellant: S.R. Wright Counsel for the Respondent: J.R.W. Caldwell Place and Date of Hearing: Vancouver, British Columbia January 17, 2020 Place and Date of Judgment: Vancouver, British Columbia January 17, 2020   Summary: The appellant challenges his  conviction for sexual interference on various grounds including that the judge  erred by: (1) editing the oral reasons for judgment after they were  delivered; and (2) shifting the burden of proof. Held: Appeal allowed  and a new trial is ordered. It is unnecessary for this Court to address the  extent to which trial judges can edit their oral reasons for judgment after  delivery. The edited reasons for judgment, standing alone, establish that the  judge erred in law by shifting the burden of proof. The judge erroneously  concluded that he could neither accept the appellant’s evidence nor find that  it raised a reasonable doubt in the absence of independent evidence  that confirmed the appellant’s denial of wrongdoing. [1]     FITCH J.A. : The appellant was convicted by a Supreme Court judge  of sexual interference contrary to s. 151 of the  Criminal Code ,  R.S.C. 1985, c. C‑46. The offence arose out of incidents said  to have occurred when the complainant was between 10–12 years of age.  At the relevant time, the appellant was 38–40 years of age. The alleged  incidents involved the appellant repeatedly touching the complainant’s breasts  and vaginal area, typically in the course of tickling her when the  complainant visited the appellant at his family’s cabin. [2]     The appellant testified. He denied ever touching the complainant for a  sexual purpose. [3]     This was the second trial in this matter — a new trial  having been ordered by this Court in reasons for judgment indexed as  2017 BCCA 417. [4]     There was no direct evidence confirming the complainant’s testimony  that the appellant repeatedly touched her breasts and vaginal area. The  trial judge recognized that the resolution of the case turned on his credibility findings  and the application of the framework set out in  R. v. W.(D.) ,  [1991] 1 S.C.R. 742, to the circumstances of this case. [5]     The three‑step  W.(D.)  analysis is designed to  assist the trier of fact in properly applying the reasonable doubt standard  to the issue of credibility. Where, as here, an accused denies the commission of the offence,  a trier of fact must find the accused not guilty if they believe  the accused’s evidence or, even if they do not believe the accused’s evidence,  they are left in reasonable doubt by it. If the trier of fact does not believe  the accused’s denial and is not left with a reasonable doubt  by the accused’s testimony, a conviction can only result where the Crown  discharges its burden of establishing guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. [6]     In oral reasons for judgment indexed as 2018 BCSC 2429,  the judge rejected the appellant’s evidence, found that the appellant’s evidence  did not raise a reasonable doubt, and accepted the complainant’s evidence  that the appellant repeatedly touched her for a sexual purpose. [7]     On appeal, the appellant submits that the judge erred by: (1) editing  the oral reasons for judgment after they were delivered; (2) shifting  the burden of proof; (3) misapprehending evidence; and (4) providing  insufficient reasons for judgment. [8]     The first ground of appeal raises an important question  of practice concerning the extent to which trial judges are entitled to  edit reasons given orally. This Court has addressed the point on  several occasions:  R. v. Walton , 2011 BCCA 535  at para. 21;  R. v. Pham  (6 September 2011),  Vancouver CA038676 (B.C.C.A. Chambers). We have consistently held that  while trial judges cannot edit or change their oral reasons “in  an attempt to defeat an appeal”, judges are entitled to edit their  reasons “to a degree” as, for example, where words have been  misspoken or some clarification is necessary. I should add that no suggestion  has been made in this case that the judge undertook an editing process  to defeat an appeal. In fact, the edited judgment was released  before the notice of appeal was filed in this Court. [9]     A similar approach to this issue was taken by the Alberta Court of Appeal  in  R. v. Schell , 2004 ABCA 143 at paras. 43 and 45.  In that case, it was held that the judge did nothing impermissible by deleting  a sentence from her oral reasons for judgment in circumstances where “the … written reasons  [did] not deviate from the general thrust of their oral predecessor”: citing Roman N. Komar,   Reasons for Judgment: A Handbook for Judges and Other Judicial Officers   (Toronto: Butterworths, 1980) at 16. [10]     It appears that a more restrictive view has been taken by the  Ontario Court of Appeal:  R. v. Wang , 2010 ONCA 435  at paras. 9–11. In that case, trial judges were cautioned  against modifying, changing or adding to a transcript of oral reasons  rendered in court except to correct “punctuation, grammatical errors  and the like.” The court endorsed the proposition that reasons for judgment  are not meant to be tentative and counsel who receive a transcript of oral reasons  should not “be left to wonder whether it in fact reflects what was said in the court,  or rather constitutes a version of the reasons as later modified by the judge.” [11]     In this case, the judge amended his oral reasons for judgment  by deleting from the transcribed version words said in court,  including language the appellant says would have supported his second ground of appeal.  The appellant submits that the amendments made were substantive in nature and  exceeded the authority trial judges have to edit oral reasons. [12]     In the alternative, the appellant argues that the edited reasons for judgment,  standing alone, establish that the judge erred in law by shifting the  burden of proof. [13]     I agree with the appellant’s alternative submission on this issue. In  my view, reversible error in law is reflected in the edited version of the  reasons for judgment. As a consequence, it is unnecessary for this  Court to address the extent to which trial judges can edit their oral reasons for judgment  to properly dispose of this appeal. In these circumstances, the issue is  best left to be explored another day. [14]     Further, as I am of the view that a new trial is required as a  consequence of the error identified in the appellant’s second ground of appeal,  I consider it unnecessary to address the appellant’s other grounds of appeal. [15]     The reasons, as edited and transcribed, reflect the following application  of the first two steps of the  W.(D.)  framework to  the evidence in this case: [72] Accordingly, the first step in the analysis in  the case at bar is whether I accept, as true, Mr. Veeken’s testimony  that he did not touch [the complainant’s] breast and vaginal areas  at any time. In this regard, the Crown characterizes Mr. Veeken’s evidence  as a “bare denial” and while the defence acknowledges that this is  so, it points out that there is “not much else” that Mr. Veeken can do to  meet the allegations against him.  It is not controversial that there is no  reliable evidence supporting Mr. Veeken’s denial. [73]  In these circumstances, I am satisfied that a  finding that Mr. Veeken’s denial is true cannot reasonably be made.   I am mindful that the defence has urged me to rely upon Mr. Veeken’s testimonial demeanour  and manner, by submitting that Mr. Veeken was forthright, gave full answers,  explained suggested inconsistencies, and was not shaken in cross‑examination.  I am not persuaded, however, that Mr. Veeken’s demeanour and manner  are a sound basis for accepting his testimony as true. Notably, the Crown did  not agree with the defence’s assessment; rather, it characterized Mr. Veeken  as glib and evasive. These widely divergent views of the   same testimony only serve to demonstrate the  frailty of manner and demeanour as the basis for determining the  truthfulness of a witness. [74]  The  next step, then, is whether Mr. Veeken’s testimony raises a  reasonable doubt as to his guilt. This is similarly problematic in the absence  of reliable evidence that supports, directly or indirectly, Mr. Veeken’s  denial.  Moreover, Mr. Veeken admits having [the complainant] on his lap  and tickling her; he admits pulling her onto his lap while in the hot tub;  and, he admits spending evenings and nights with only [the complainant] and  her nine‑year‑old brother. [Emphasis added.] [16]     In my view, these paragraphs support the appellant’s submission  that his evidence was rejected and found not to raise a reasonable doubt  because it was not confirmed by any other reliable evidence. Beyond the  obvious challenge of requiring the appellant to adduce evidence supporting  his denial — in effect, to corroborate a negative — the trial judge’s approach  had the effect of erroneously shifting the burden of proof. [17]     The judge was certainly entitled to reject the appellant’s evidence  and find that it did not raise a reasonable doubt about his guilt.  The difficulty in this case arises because of the judge’s conclusion that  he could neither accept the appellant’s evidence nor find that it raised a  reasonable doubt in the absence of independent and reliable evidence  supporting his account. To approach the issue this way was to  erroneously shift the burden to the accused to adduce evidence  that confirmed his denial of wrongdoing. [18]     While I appreciate that the reasons for judgment must be read  in their entirety and assessed as a whole, the error in law was the  starting place for the judge’s  W.(D.)  analysis and, in my view,  one so fundamental that it taints his reasons as a whole. [19]     For the foregoing reasons, I would allow the appeal, set aside the conviction,  and order a new trial. [20]     In light of the disposition, I propose it is unnecessary  to resolve the application to admit fresh evidence. [21]     SAUNDERS J.A. : I agree. [22]     GRAUER J.A. : I agree. [23]     SAUNDERS J.A. : The appeal is allowed, the conviction  is set aside, and there is an order for a new trial. “The Honourable Mr. Justice Fitch”"},"meta":{},"created_at":"2022-03-08T08:08:14.438603Z","updated_at":"2022-03-10T00:33:17.835887Z","project":2},{"id":31,"annotations":[{"id":37,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"start":0,"end":37,"text":"COURT OF APPEAL FOR BRITISH  COLUMBIA","labels":["COURT_NAME"]},"id":"3e22ace8-9","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":172,"end":188,"text":"Neil  E.

Her Majesty the Queen in the Right of   British Columbia,   2022 BCCA 38 Date: 20220201 Docket: CA47869 Between: Neil  E. Thomson Appellant (Plaintiff) And Her  Majesty the Queen in the Right of British Columbia, Interior Health Authority,  Royal Inland Hospital, Kamloops Mental Health and Substance Use, Dr. Kurt  Buller and Dr. James Mabee Respondents (Defendants) Before: The Honourable Mr. Justice Goepel (In Chambers) On appeal from: An  order of the Supreme Court of British Columbia, dated October 28, 2020 ( Thomson  v. British Columbia (Interior Health) , 2020 BCSC 1591, Kamloops Docket  58631).  The Appellant, appearing in person     (via videoconference): N.E. Thomson Counsel for the Respondent, Her Majesty the Queen in the   Right of the Province of British Columbia     (via videoconference): L.F. de Lima    J. Salter, Articled Student Counsel for the Respondents, Interior Health Authority,   Royal Inland Hospital, Kamloops Mental Health & Substance Use (via   videoconference): D.J.A. Bell    E. Dvorak Counsel for the Respondents, Dr. Kurt Buller and Dr. James   Mabee     (via videoconference): D.C. Froese Place and Date of Hearing: Vancouver, British   Columbia January 6, 2022 Place and Date of Judgment: Vancouver, British   Columbia February 1, 2022 Summary: The  appellant’s application seeks an extension of time to file an appeal from a  judgment dated October 28, 2020. Held: Application dismissed. The appeal was  brought over a year out of time. Upon an application of the Davies factors,  there is no evidence that the appellant had a bona fide intention to appeal  during the relevant appeal period, the appeal has no merit, and the interests  of justice do not favour granting the application.  Reasons for Judgment of the Honourable  Mr. Justice Goepel: [1]     The appellant, Neil Thomson, seeks to appeal the order of Justice Dley  made on October 28, 2020, dismissing the appellant’s claim on the basis of  res  judicata . Justice Dley’s reasons are indexed at 2020 BCSC 1591. [2]     The appellant filed his notice of leave to appeal on November 3, 2021,  more than one year after the release of the reasons for judgment. He now  applies for leave to appeal, an order to extend the time period to bring his  application for leave to appeal and a no fees order. [3]     On July 12, 2016, the appellant commenced Action number 053209 (the  “2016 Action”), for damages allegedly sustained from the appellant’s  involuntary admission to Royal Inland Hospital pursuant to the  Mental Health  Act , R.S.B.C. 1996 c. 288 between November 2000 and his ultimate  discharge from involuntary patient status in February 2013.  [4]     Justice Meiklem dismissed the 2016 Action on September 29, 2017 on the  grounds that it was barred by the  Limitation Act , R.S.B.C. 1996,  c. 266. In his reasons for judgment, he held that the basic two-year  limitation period for the appellant’s cause of action arose on October 4, 2012,  and the postponement provisions of the  Limitation Act  did not apply.  Justice Meiklem’s reasons are indexed at 2017 BCSC 1742. This Court, in reasons  indexed at 2018 BCCA 380, affirmed Justice Meiklem’s decision. The appellant’s  application for leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada was refused:  [2018] S.C.C.A. No. 38489. [5]     On February 12, 2020, the appellant commenced Action No. 058631  [the “2020 Action”] against the same defendants and for the same relief or  similar relief as the 2016 Action. On October 8, 2020, Justice Dley heard the  defendant’s application to dismiss the 2020 Action. At the hearing before  Justice Dley, the appellant argued that new evidence distinguished the 2020  Action from the 2016 Action.  [6]     In his reasons released on October 28, 2020, Justice Dley dismissed the  2016 Action. He considered the new evidence and found it would not be  practically conclusive and therefore did not justify reopening an issue that  had already been decided. In that regard, he said:  [14]     It cannot be said the proposed new evidence entirely changes the case.  The nature of the new evidence was already considered in the trial decision and  on appeal. I therefore conclude that the new evidence would not be practically  conclusive and so does not justify reopening an issue that has already been  decided. [7]     Justice Dley held that the action should be dismissed based on the  doctrine of  res judicata.  In his reasons he noted that the doctrine has  two aspects, being issue estoppel and cause of action estoppel. He found that  both applied in this case. In that regard, he said: [17] I conclude that issue estoppel applies in these  circumstances. Mr. Thomson must show that he has brought his claim within  the allowable limitation period before this action can proceed. The prior  action considered this issue and held that the action was statute barred. I  therefore find: a) The same question (i.e. whether the action can be  brought) has already been decided; b) The decision in the prior action was final; and c) The parties in both action[s] are the same. [18] I also conclude that cause of action estoppel  applies because: a) The trial decision, as affirmed on appeal, was final; b) The parties to this litigation are the same as those  in the prior action; c) The cause of action was the same, i.e. Mr. Thomson  being detained under the  MHA ; and d) All matters as argued here (including references to  the  Charter ) were argued or could have been argued in the prior action. [8]     In the result, he held the action must be dismissed under the doctrine  of  res judicata. [9]     The appellant’s time limit to appeal the order of Justice Dley expired  on November 27, 2020. The appellant took no steps until filing a notice of  application for leave to appeal on November 3, 2021. The defendants had no  notice of the appellant’s intention to appeal until served with the notice of  application for leave. [10]     The criteria governing whether an extension of time ought to be granted  are set out in  Davies v. Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce , (1987) 15  B.C.L.R. (2d) 256 (C.A.) at 259–260. They are: 1. Was there a  bona fide   intention to appeal? 2. When were the respondents  informed of the intention? 3. Would the respondents be  unduly prejudiced by an extension? 4. Is there merit in the  appeal? 5. Is it in the interest of  justice that an extension be granted? [11]     The overriding question is whether it is in the interests of justice to  grant the extension:  First Majestic Silver Corp. v. Santos , 2014 BCCA  214 at para. 57, leave to appeal ref’d, [2014] S.C.C.A. No. 35962. [12]     An extension of time to file a notice for appeal should not be granted  if the appeal is without merit:  Franks v. British Columbia (B.C. Benefits  Board) , 1999 BCCA 165 (Proudfoot J.A. in Chambers) at para. 10, aff’d  1999 BCCA 407, leave to appeal ref’d, [1999] S.C.C.A. No. 361;  Stewart  v. Postnikoff , 2015 BCCA 388 at para. 10. [13]     At the hearing of the application it was agreed that the appellant does  not need leave to appeal. He can appeal Justice Dley’s decision as of right. He  does, however, require an extension of time. It is to that issue I now turn. [14]     The appeal was brought more than a year out of time. There is no  evidence that the appellant had a  bona fide  intention of appealing  during the appeal period. The respondents only learned of the appeal when they were  served with the appellant’s notice of leave to appeal. More importantly, there  is no merit in the appeal. The limitation issue, which doomed the 2016 Action,  remains an unsurmountable bar to the 2020 Action. As noted by Justice Dley, the  2016 Action found the action statute barred and this claim could only proceed  if the appellant can show that he brought the claim within the allowable  limitation period. The appellant is unable to do so. [15]     Given the above circumstances, it is not in the interests of justice to  grant an extension of time to bring the appeal. I would dismiss the  application. Given this result, it is not necessary to consider the no fee  application. “The  Honourable Mr. Justice Goepel”"},"meta":{},"created_at":"2022-03-08T08:08:14.438481Z","updated_at":"2022-03-10T00:30:02.149495Z","project":2},{"id":30,"annotations":[{"id":36,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"start":3,"end":41,"text":"THE SUPREME COURT OF BRITISH COLUMBIA ","labels":["COURT_NAME"]},"id":"3e22b5c6-9","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":202,"end":240,"text":"Trans Canada  Insurance Marketing Inc.","labels":["PERS_APPELLANT"]},"id":"3e22b5f8-9","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":443,"end":477,"text":"The Honourable Madam Justice Forth","labels":["PERS_JUDGE"]},"id":"3e22b634-9","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":291,"end":322,"text":"Fransen Insurance Services Ltd.","labels":["PERS_RESPONDENT"]},"id":"3e22b666-9","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":255,"end":287,"text":"Fransen Insurance  Services Ltd.","labels":["PERS_RESPONDENT"]},"id":"3e22b698-9","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":327,"end":356,"text":"Sea to Ski Insurance Services","labels":["PERS_RESPONDENT"]},"id":"3e22b6ca-9","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":359,"end":381,"text":" Antony Ronald Fransen","labels":["PERS_RESPONDENT"]},"id":"3e22b706-9","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":387,"end":422,"text":"InsureBC Underwriting Services Inc.","labels":["PERS_RESPONDENT"]},"id":"3e22b738-9","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":534,"end":545,"text":"M.D. Murphy","labels":["PERS_COUNS_APPEL"]},"id":"3e22b76a-9","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":597,"end":610,"text":"H.

Plaintiff And Fransen Insurance  Services Ltd.,   Fransen Insurance Services Ltd. dba Sea to Ski Insurance Services,   Antony Ronald Fransen, and InsureBC Underwriting Services Inc. Defendants Before:  The Honourable Madam Justice Forth Reasons for Judgment on Cost Counsel for the Plaintiff: M.D. Murphy Counsel for InsureBC Underwriting Services Inc.:   H. Poulus Q.C. A. Crimeni No other appearances   Place and Date of Written Submissions:   Submissions from the Defendant:   Submissions from the Plaintiff: Vancouver, B.C.   August 29, 2019   September   12, 2019 Reply submissions from the Defendant: September 19, 2019 Place and Date of Judgment: Vancouver, B.C. January 6, 2020   [1]     These reasons deal with an application to vary my order for costs made  after the trial in this matter. The underlying action involved claims by the  plaintiff, Trans Canada Insurance Marketing Inc. (“Trans Canada”), against  InsureBC Underwriting Services (“InsureBC”) and three other defendants. In  December 2016, Trans Canada obtained default judgment against all of the  defendants except InsureBC. The trial was conducted for the purpose of  assessing damages on the default judgments and to try the issues against  InsureBC brought pursuant to the  Fraudulent Conveyance Act , R.S.B.C.  1996, c. 163 (the “ FCA ”), the  Fraudulent Preference Act ,  R.S.B.C. 1996, c. 164 (the “ FPA ”), and on the basis of unjust  enrichment.  [2]     On July 30, 2019, I issued reasons for judgment, indexed at 2019 BCSC  1250 (the “Reasons”), dismissing all of the plaintiff’s claims against  InsureBC. Trans Canada was ordered to pay InsureBC its costs at Scale B, but  leave was granted for the parties to make written submissions to vary the cost  order within 30 days of receipt of the Reasons.  [3]     On August 29, 2019, InsureBC filed written submissions seeking double  costs against the plaintiff for all steps taken in the litigation from the date  of an offer to settle made on November 26, 2018 (the “Offer”). On September 12,  2019, Trans Canada filed its response opposing the application. The Offer  provided: Our client is confident that [Trans Canada]’s claim against  it will be dismissed in its entirety. However, in recognition that our client  will incur legal fees in the short term defending this lawsuit, our client is  willing to settle this matter on the following terms: 1.   InsureBC  will pay [Trans Canada] $10,000 (the “Sum”), in full and final settlement of  its claim against InsureBC; 2.   The Sum is  inclusive of interest and costs; 3.   [Trans  Canada] will execute a release in a form acceptable to counsel; and 4.     [Trans Canada] will execute a consent dismissal order. [4]     The Offer was made without prejudice except as to costs. InsureBC  expressly reserved the right to bring the Offer to the attention of the Court  for consideration in relation to costs after judgment was pronounced, pursuant  to Rule 9-1 of the  Supreme Court Civil Rules , B.C. Reg. 168\/2009 (the “ Rules ”).   [5]     The only issue to be addressed in these reasons is whether the costs  order should be varied to grant InsureBC double costs for all steps taken after  November 26, 2018.  [6]     The parties agree on the law that applies to the consideration of this  issue.  [7]     Rule 9-1(4) of the  Rules  provides that the Court may consider an  offer to settle when exercising its discretion in relation to costs. In a  proceeding in which an offer to settle has been made, Rule 9-1(5)(b) allows the  Court to award double costs of all or some of the steps taken in the proceeding  after the date of delivery or service of the offer to settle. Such an award is  a punitive measure against a litigant for their failure to accept an offer to  settle that, in all of the circumstances, should have been accepted:  Hartshorne  v. Hartshorne , 2011 BCCA 29 at para. 25.  [8]     Under Rule 9-1(6), the following factors may be considered in making an  order for costs in a proceeding in which an offer to settle has been made: (a)     whether the offer to settle was one that ought reasonably to have been  accepted; (b)     the relationship between the terms of settlement offered and the final  judgment of the court; (c)     the relative financial circumstances of the parties; and (d)     any other factor the court considers appropriate.  [9]     Whether an offer ought reasonably to have been accepted must be  determined by reference to the time the offer was open for acceptance, not by  reference to the ultimate decision:  Hartshorne  at para. 27.  Hartshorne   set out the following (non-exhaustive) factors for courts to consider in  deciding whether an offer ought reasonably to have been accepted:  (a)     the timing of the offer; (b)     whether the offer had some relationship to the claim or was instead a  nuisance offer; (c)     whether the offeree could easily have evaluated the offer; and (d)   whether the offeror provided  some rationale for the offer. [10]     The onus is on the party seeking to displace the usual rule as to costs,  which in this case is InsureBC:  Giles v. Westminster Savings Credit Union ,  2010 BCCA 282 at para. 75. [11]     InsureBC argues that the Offer was one that ought reasonably to have  been accepted. It was delivered two weeks before the start of the trial after  document disclosure, oral discoveries, and the trial management conference had  taken place. Therefore, Trans Canada should have been aware of the frailties of  its claim against InsureBC. It was in a position to easily evaluate the Offer,  which did not impact its ability to proceed against the other named defendants. [12]     InsureBC submits that the Offer was made in good faith in an attempt to  obtain certainty and resolve the matter without going to trial and incurring  further legal fees. The Offer was comprehensive and would have removed the need  for InsureBC to attend the five-day trial, which would have shortened the trial  length to two days, resulting in savings for the Court and the parties.  [13]     InsureBC points to the fact that the terms of the Offer are  significantly better than the result achieved at trial, as the claims against  it were dismissed in their entirety on the basis that Trans Canada lacked  standing to pursue its claim under the  FCA  and the  FPA  and the  elements for unjust enrichment were not made out.  [14]     Finally, InsureBC submits that both Trans Canada and InsureBC are sophisticated  commercial entities and a double costs award would do no measureable harm to  Trans Canada’s financial status.  [15]     Trans Canada submits that there were several issues to be resolved in  its claims against InsureBC, making it reasonable to decide to proceed to trial  rather than accept the Offer. It submits that the evidence was capable of  supporting a claim against InsureBC, but the Court’s interpretation of the  evidence ultimately led to the claim being dismissed. [16]     Trans Canada argues that it should not be penalized for pursuing the  action at trial based on its assessment of the merits, which proved to be  incorrect in hindsight but were reasonable and honestly held at the time. In  support of this point, Trans Canada points to the fact that it was successful  on several issues at trial, including the finding that the book of business was  “property” and that the assignment of the book of business constituted a  “disposition” under the relevant legislation.  [17]     Trans Canada argues that the Offer came late in the day and it could not  be considered a reasonable offer; it was a nuisance or nominal offer. There was  nothing relating the Offer to the merits of the claim or the risk associated  with proceeding to trial that would have allowed Trans Canada to determine  whether it was reasonable. Instead, the Offer was predicated on the fact that  InsureBC would have to incur legal fees defending the lawsuit. It amounted to a  bald assertion that the claim would be dismissed, and given the fact that Trans  Canada sought an award in excess of $230,000, the amount offered by InsureBC  was a mere nuisance offer. [18]     Considering the factors set out by the Court of Appeal in  Hartshorne ,  I conclude that the Offer was one which ought reasonably to have been accepted  by Trans Canada.  [19]     I disagree that the timing of the Offer indicates that it was a mere  nuisance offer. To the contrary, I accept that the fact that the Offer came  late in the day, after discovery of documents and of key witnesses had taken  place and after the parties had participated in a trial management conference,  meant that Trans Canada would have known about the issues with its case against  InsureBC and would have been in a position to meaningfully evaluate the offer. [20]     Although it is true that Trans Canada was successful on certain issues  at trial, there were significant flaws in its position on key issues in its  case against InsureBC, which would have been apparent at the time the Offer was  made. In particular, its lack of standing as a “creditor” under either the  FCA   or the  FPA  meant that those claims were bound to fail. The evidence  about when Trans Canada became a creditor compared to when the alleged  fraudulent transfer of property took place was not ambiguous. [21]     The unjust enrichment claim similarly had substantial vulnerabilities,  particularly because the enrichment InsureBC gained on the contract did not  produce a corresponding deprivation to Trans Canada. Again, this flaw in the claim  was not the result of ambiguities requiring the Court’s interpretation of the  evidence before the parties could assess the strength of the argument, and it  should have been known to Trans Canada at the time the Offer was made. [22]     I also disagree that the Offer failed to provide a rationale for the  settlement or that Trans Canada had insufficient information to determine  whether the Offer was reasonable. As stated above, I accept that at the time  the Offer was made, Trans Canada had knowledge of the evidence and of the  parties’ positions, which would allow it to assess the reasonableness of the  Offer. The Offer is clear that InsureBC’s position was that the claims against  it would be dismissed in their entirety and that the basis for the Offer was to  save the legal fees it would incur defending the claim at trial.  [23]     This factor weighs in favour of allowing InsureBC’s application to vary  costs. [24]     The relationship between the terms of the Offer and my final judgment in  this matter also weighs in favour of allowing InsureBC’s application. In my  Reasons, I dismissed the claims against InsureBC in their entirety and awarded  costs in their favour. A $10,000 offer would have been a significantly better  result for Trans Canada. [25]     Furthermore, because the Offer was comprehensive, its acceptance would  have meant that InsureBC’s participation in the trial would not be necessary.  Such an outcome would have significantly narrowed the issues and saved both parties  and the Court three days of time and expense.  [26]     In the absence of any contrary submissions from Trans Canada, I accept  InsureBC’s submission that an award for double costs on steps taken after the Offer  was presented would not do significant financial harm to Trans Canada. Both  parties are commercial entities and they are comparable in terms of their level  of sophistication.  [27]     I find that InsureBC has met its onus of demonstrating that an award for  double costs for steps taken in the litigation after the date of the Offer  should be granted.  [28]     The costs order will be varied to award: (a)     InsureBC its costs at Scale B to November 26, 2018; and (b)   InsureBC double costs at  Scale B in respect of all steps taken in the proceeding after November 26,  2018. “Forth  J.”"},"meta":{},"created_at":"2022-03-08T08:08:14.438378Z","updated_at":"2022-03-10T00:20:45.576410Z","project":2},{"id":52,"annotations":[{"id":58,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"start":3,"end":40,"text":"THE SUPREME COURT OF BRITISH COLUMBIA","labels":["COURT_NAME"]},"id":"3e217788-9","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":381,"end":393,"text":"P.J.

THE SUPREME COURT OF BRITISH COLUMBIA Citation: 1449 Sandhurst Place Holdings Ltd. (Re),   2022 BCSC 62 Date: 20220111 Docket: B210542 Registry:  Vancouver In  Bankruptcy and Insolvency   In the Matter of  the Bankruptcy of 1449 Sandhurst Place Holdings Ltd.   Before:  The Honourable Mr. Justice Milman Oral Reasons for Judgment Counsel for the Applicant, Jeana Ventures Ltd.: P.J. Reardon Counsel for the Debtor, 1449 Sandhurst Place Holdings Ltd.: H.A. Frydenlund Counsel for the Attendee, ADC Holdings Ltd.: M.C. Sennott Place and Date of Hearing: Vancouver, B.C. January 7, 2022 Place and Date of Judgment: Vancouver, B.C. January 11, 2022   [1]     This is an application for a bankruptcy order under s. 43 of the  Bankruptcy  and Insolvency Act , R.S.C. 1985, c. B-5 [ BIA ]. The applicant, Jeana  Ventures Ltd. (“Jeana”) is a shareholder of the debtor, a company called 1449  Sandhurst Place Holdings Ltd. (“Sandhurst”). The application is opposed by  Sandhurst’s other shareholder, ADC Projects Ltd. (“ADC”). ADC holds 51% of the  shares in Sandhurst in trust for Jeana. [2]     Sandhurst is a single-purpose entity that, until recently, held title to  an investment property in West Vancouver. The relationship between the two  shareholders has broken down and they have been and continue to be embroiled in  other litigation concerning Sandhurst and its affairs, among other things. It  is that other litigation that forms the basis of ADC’s opposition to this  application. [3]     Jeana says that Sandhurst owes it a debt in excess of $1,000 and has committed  an act of bankruptcy in the last six months, thereby satisfying the conditions  for a bankruptcy order under that provision. The act of bankruptcy alleged is  that Sandhurst has ceased to pay its liabilities as they become due. Those  liabilities include, primarily, a shareholder loan owing to Jeana in the amount  of $1,714,497 plus interest and costs, of which $545,267 is said to be secured  by way of a mortgage. Jeana also alleges that Sandhurst has failed to pay two  higher ranking mortgages and a lien claim that had, until recently, encumbered  title to the West Vancouver property that was Sandhurst’s main asset. [4]     I say “until recently” because, in other litigation, ADC sought a  winding-up order in relation to Sandhurst under s. 324 of the  Business Corporations  Act , S.B.C. 2002, c. 57. In that proceeding, Horsman J. made an order  placing Sandhurst into receivership. The receiver has since sold the investment  property. The two mortgages ranking ahead of Jeana’s indebtedness have been  paid in full from the proceeds of sale. The lien has been discharged. [5]     By order made by Coval J. on October 6, 2021, the receiver was permitted  to pay the balance left after payment of various administrative and  receivership costs, being a net sum of $543,048.10, to Jeana’s lawyers in  trust, once the receiver is satisfied that no funds are owing to the Canada  Revenue Agency (“CRA”). [6]     Jeana is seeking a bankruptcy order so that it can reverse the  priorities and be paid those funds now, ahead of any claim on them that may be  advanced by the CRA. Jeana cites  Bank of Montreal v. Scott Road Enterprises  Ltd ., (1989) 36 B.C.L.R. (2d) 118 (C.A.), as authority for the proposition  that this is a valid and proper purpose for seeking a bankruptcy order. [7]     ADC disputes that Jeana is a creditor of Sandhurst with standing to  bring this application. According to ADC, it and Jeana are parties to a shareholders’  agreement that contains a shotgun buyout clause. That clause is said to permit  either shareholder to force a buyout of the shares and shareholder loans held  by the other shareholder. Jeana says that it duly triggered that clause on  October 20, 2020 and that, consequently, Jeana has been obliged since then to  sell to ADC its shares and its shareholder loan position for $800,000, but it  has refused to do so.  [8]     Jeana denies that the shotgun buyout clause was properly invoked. It has  commenced its own action against ADC, arguing that ADC and its principal are  guilty of serious breaches of fiduciary duty, including misappropriation of  funds and various fraudulent acts in relation to the Sandhurst venture and  other business they have been involved in together. ADC has brought a  counterclaim in that action, seeking, among other things, to enforce the buyout  obligation. The action is scheduled to go to trial on October 17, 2022 for 15  days. [9]     On that basis, ADC says that Jeana has, at best, only questionable standing  as a creditor of Sandhurst to seek a bankruptcy order. It cites various  authorities for the proposition that in the absence of clear evidence that the  requisite preconditions for the order are satisfied, the application should be  refused. In particular, it has been held that where the underlying debt forming  the foundation for the order is disputed, the matter should go to trial, rather  than be resolved in bankruptcy court; see:  Inex Pharmaceuticals Corp. (Re) ,  2006 BCCA 108 at para. 19;  Aquasure Technologies Inc .  (Re) ,  [2008] 45 C.B.R. (5th) 300 at para. 6;  Bearcat Exploration Ltd .  (Re) ,  2003 ABCA 365, at para. 15. ADC also cites  Sather Ranch Ltd. (Re) , 2019  BCSC 677, as an example of a case in which the court refused to make a  bankruptcy order when the real dispute was seen to be between two shareholders  who were at loggerheads, rather than about a clearly insolvent enterprise  unable to satisfy its obligations as they came due. [10]     Jeana argues that ADC’s authorities are distinguishable, insofar as they  all involved a  bona fide  dispute raised by the debtor, rather than a  shareholder, as to the existence or extent of the underlying debt asserted by  the applicant creditor. I pause to note that the facts in  Sather   Ranch   in particular are not so easily distinguished on that basis. There, the  validity and extent of the applicant shareholder’s debt was, as here,  challenged by the other shareholder, rather than by the debtor company itself.  [11]     But I agree that  Sather Ranch  is distinguishable on other  grounds, insofar as the result in that case flowed partly from a finding that  the applicant shareholder was pursuing a bankruptcy “as a tactical move … to  use the  BIA  to his advantage” in the ongoing dispute between the  shareholders. The reason Jeana has given for seeking a bankruptcy order in this  case is to reverse priorities. In addition, the court in  Sather   Ranch   was unable on the evidence before it to discern the actual state of  accounts as between the parties, a controversy that was held to be more  properly dealt with in the related litigation.  [12]     Jeana relies on  0757376 B.C. Ltd. (Re) , 2011 BCSC 1268. In that  case, Burnyeat J. dismissed an appeal from a master’s bankruptcy order. The  master had granted that order on the application of a shareholder and creditor,  relying on the debtor company’s failure to repay the debt that it owed to him,  despite the fact that the extent of the indebtedness was disputed by another  shareholder. The result appears to have turned on the fact that the debtor  company had clearly failed in the previous six months to meet its obligations  as they became due and at least $1,000 was clearly owed to the petitioning  shareholder, even if the precise amount of the indebtedness was disputed.  [13]     In this case, what is in issue is not the state of the accounts between  the parties but rather whether the debt that is admittedly owing is properly  owed to Jeana or ADC.  [14]     Regardless of the outcome in the other litigation between the parties,  it is not seriously disputed that Jeana is presently owed the debt that it  asserts. In that regard, Jeana notes that the order of Coval J. made October 6,  2021 has directed that the net balance of the sale proceeds be paid to Jeana’s  solicitors, in partial payment of the same debt that is asserted on this  application, or at least the secured portion of it. I agree that it would be  inconsistent for this court to refuse the relief sought on this application on  the basis that the unsecured portion of that same debt may not be owing to  Jeana after all.  [15]     The relief that ADC seeks in the related litigation includes an order  compelling Jeana to sell its shares and shareholder loan position to ADC  following the final disposition of the matter. ADC does not allege that such a  sale has already occurred or that Jeana has been holding its interest in the  loan in trust for ADC since October 20, 2020. There is no interim order in  place that restricts the exercise of Jeana’s rights as creditor. [16]     Jeana’s loan to Sandhurst was stated to be repayable on demand. On  November 16, 2021, Jeana demanded repayment. Sandhurst was unable to repay the  outstanding balance, given that its only significant asset had recently been  sold through a receivership, leaving a sizeable shortfall well in excess of  $1,000. [17]     In summary, I am satisfied that both elements of the test have been  satisfied and that there is no reason to refuse the relief sought. I am  therefore granting the application. [18]     As the successful party, Jeana is entitled to its costs. “Milman  J.”"},"meta":{},"created_at":"2022-03-08T08:08:14.441206Z","updated_at":"2022-03-08T08:08:14.441220Z","project":2},{"id":51,"annotations":[{"id":57,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"start":3,"end":40,"text":"THE SUPREME COURT OF BRITISH COLUMBIA","labels":["COURT_NAME"]},"id":"3e218a7a-9","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":151,"end":157,"text":"A.M.S.","labels":["PERS_APPELLANT"]},"id":"3e218aac-9","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":171,"end":177,"text":"J.R.A.","labels":["PERS_RESPONDENT"]},"id":"3e218ade-9","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":411,"end":438,"text":"The Honourable Justice Lamb","labels":["PERS_JUDGE"]},"id":"3e218b24-9","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":575,"end":586,"text":"K.W.

Respondent Corrected  Judgment: The front page of the judgment was corrected on February 14, 2022. Corrected Judgment:  Reference to the childrens’ birthdays at para. 2 have been changed to  [birthday] on February 14, 2022. Before:  The Honourable Justice Lamb Oral Ruling Re Application for an Order Pursuant to  s. 61(2)(c) for Compensatory Parenting Time In  Chambers Counsel for the Claimant: K.W. Wince Counsel for the Respondent: F. Jhuty appearing  as agent for   M. Mand Place and Date of Hearing: New Westminster, B.C. January 6, 2022 Place and Date of Judgment: New Westminster, B.C. January 7, 2022   [1]     THE COURT:  In this family law action the claimant, A.S., seeks  an order pursuant to s. 61(2)(c) for compensatory parenting time to make  up for parenting time that the respondent, J.A., would not allow him to  exercise. Mr. S also seeks an order pursuant to s. 61(2)(g) that Ms. A  pay a nominal fine for wrongfully denying his parenting time. [2]     The parties started living together on June 1, 2008, and were married on  August 11, 2012. The parties separated on September 9, 2019. There are two  children of the marriage: G, born [birthday]; and J, born [birthday].  [3]     Mr. S filed a notice of family claim on May 29, 2020, seeking  a shared parenting arrangement and other relief.  [4]     On October 1, 2020, Mr. S brought a contested application for  parenting time that was heard before Justice Duncan. On October 13, 2020,  Justice Duncan made an interim parenting order that gave the parties joint  parenting responsibilities for the children's health with a requirement to  consult, and Ms. A was given the deciding vote in the event of the parties  not agreeing. Justice Duncan ordered gradually increasing parenting time for Mr. S.  He was entitled to parenting time on Wednesdays from 4:00 p.m. to 7:00 p.m.,  and the parties have agreed that he will have parenting time every second  weekend from Friday to Sunday evening. [5]     Justice Duncan also made the following orders: Para. 5: If there was a report of  a COVID‑19 case at the school where Mr. S works, then his parenting  time would be suspended until he provides proof that he tested negative for  COVID‑19.  Para. 6: Both parties will  continue to minimize contact between the Children and anyone outside the  immediate family. \"Immediate family\" was defined to include both sets  of grandparents.  [6]     Paragraph 7 of Justice Duncan's order provided that if Mr. S's  parents had an exchange student living with them, then the student would not be  part of the family contact group, and Mr. S's parents would be required to  wear masks while spending time with the Children. [7]     Justice Duncan's order remains in full force and effect, though the  parties agreed to a consent order that has been submitted for filing but not  yet entered that varies Justice Duncan's order. The consent order removes the  requirement that Mr. S have a negative COVID‑19 test (para. 5),  and once the children are double vaccinated, removes the restrictions on  contacts (para. 6 and 7). The children received their first vaccine on  November 30, 2021, and Ms. A expects they will have their second vaccine  in February 2022. [8]     It is because of her concerns around the COVID‑19 pandemic that Ms. A  refused to allow Mr. S to exercise his parenting time on December 1,  2021, and has continued to refuse his having parenting time since then, aside  from a two‑hour visit on Christmas Day. Ms. A says that she believes  that it is in the best interests of the children's health and in particular J's  health to discontinue Mr. S's parenting time until the children have  received their second vaccine. Ms. A relies on s. 62(1)(f) and says  that the denial of parenting time was not wrongful because she properly  exercised her parenting responsibility for J's health.  [9]     To place Ms. A's perspective in context, I will briefly review J's  medical history. In October 2017, at age three, J spent six days in Royal  Inland Hospital with a diagnosis of croup. In March 2019, J had another episode  of croup that sent him to the emergency department. In anticipation of the  interim parenting application and at Ms. A's request, J's family doctor  prepared a letter dated June 22, 2020, to explain J's health and how the COVID‑19  pandemic affects his health. The family doctor stated that J is an otherwise  healthy child but that he was hospitalized for two episodes of croup, which is  a respiratory illness caused by a virus or bacteria. [10]     In terms of the impact of the pandemic on J, the family doctor explained  there was limited information at that time with regards to risk factors for developing  severe disease, but \"croup is a respiratory illness that may pose […] a  higher risk.\" In terms of recommendations to be followed in regard to J  or both children, the family doctor offered the standard public health  recommendations such as washing hands, physical distancing and wearing a mask. The  family doctor also said this: To further reduce risk of  transmission, it has been recommended to reduce the number of interactions  between individuals. For example, Dr. Bonnie Henry recommends staying in  your current bubble and not expanding to others. This is in reference to  staying with whom they currently reside. This is to protect against  transmission from one home to another. [11]     I note that even when specifically asked, the family doctor did not  recommend that special restrictions beyond the public health guidelines were  required to account for J's medical history. [12]     J's history of being hospitalized for croup and the family doctor's  letter dated June 22, 2020, were included as part of the evidence on the  interim parenting application. Based on all the evidence before her, Justice  Duncan did not order that Mr. S needed to limit his contacts with others  or to observe particular conduct guidelines as a condition of his parenting  time. Justice Duncan ordered that the parties would continue to minimize the  contacts that the children had with anyone outside the immediate family, but  she did not place any such restrictions on Mr. S's contacts or on Ms. A's  contacts for that matter. As noted in her response to this application: [Ms. A] has chosen to  follow extremely strict self‑isolating protocols to ensure the health and  safety of the children. [13]     In her response, she lists various concerns that she has about Mr. S's  conduct. For example, the trigger for her refusing parenting time on  December 1, 2020, was Mr. S's visit to his brother's house a few days  prior. Based on Mr. S's evidence, I accept that his visit to his brother  complied with public health orders in effect at the time. As for the other  concerns identified by Ms. A, I am not convinced that any of them when  viewed objectively and reasonably would justify withholding the parenting time  granted in the October 2020 order on medical grounds. [14]     Ms. A says that a letter dated December 18, 2021, from the same  family physician who wrote the June 2020 letter provides justification for  withholding parenting time for medical reasons. I disagree. The family doctor  noted that as new variants such as Omicron emerge, there are concerns about  increased transmissibility and severity of illness. She repeats her comment  that \"croup is a respiratory illness that may pose a higher risk\" and  acknowledges that J may be at greater risk of hospitalization than the average  child if he were to acquire COVID‑19. [15]     When specifically asked whether J needs to be fully vaccinated before  increasing exposure to others, the family doctor referred to the BC Centre For  Disease Control, Ministry of Health and Public Health Officer guidelines. When  asked for recommendations in regard to whether there is anything specific that J's  parents should do given J's health and the COVID‑19 pandemic, the family  doctor repeated her recommendations from her June 2020 letter. In other words,  despite very pointed questions, the family doctor did not recommend or advise  more restrictions on conduct or contacts for J or his family than are provided  for in public health guidelines. In particular, the family doctor did not  recommend that the parties needed to follow \"extremely strict self‑isolating  protocols\" to better ensure J's health and safety. [16]     As another reason to limit J's contact with Mr. S, Ms. A  points to some orthodontic work that J is scheduled to have in January 2022,  saying it will have to be delayed if J contracts COVID‑19. Again, the  family doctor has not recommended any enhanced health precautions for J. Anticipated  orthodontic work does not constitute a medical reason to deprive the children  of parenting time with their father. [17]     In summary, the ultimate authority to make decisions about the  children's health granted to Ms. A on an interim basis does not give her  the right to override the order for parenting time when there are no new  recommendations for protecting J’s health and there is no cogent basis to  conclude that Mr. S is contravening the recommendations from J's family  doctor, which are essentially to follow public health guidelines. [18]     In considering whether Ms. A has wrongfully denied parenting time  to Mr. S, I have considered what Justice Betton said at para. 57 of   K.R. v. J.W. , 2016 BCSC 225, about the purpose and effect of ss. 61  and 62 of the  Family Law Act,  S.B.C. 2011, c. 25.: [57] Parenting time that has  been included in an agreement or that has been ordered must be respected. If  not appealed or varied, compliance cannot be viewed as optional…. Section 62  ensures reasonable denials are permitted, again consistent with the best  interests of the children being the only consideration. [19]     I am satisfied that Mr. S has met the onus on him to establish that  Ms. A has wrongfully denied him parenting time. Pursuant to s. 61(2)(c)  of the  Family Law Act , Mr. S will have compensatory parenting time  with the children, G and J. He has now missed three weekend visits with the  children. Ms. S will have his usual parenting time with the children, that  is Friday evening to Sunday evening, for the next six consecutive weekends  starting this weekend before resuming the usual alternating weekend schedule. If  both parties agree in writing, Mr. S may exercise his compensatory weekend  parenting time sometime other than over the next six weeks. [20]     Mr. S has also missed a total of 18 hours of parenting time by  virtue of missing six Wednesday afternoon parenting time periods. Mr. S is  entitled to compensatory parenting time that he may exercise on a statutory  holiday or a professional development day or other weekday when the children  are not in school. His weekday compensatory time may be exercised over at most  three different weekdays. Mr. S may choose the weekday on which he will  exercise this additional time by notifying Ms. A in writing at least a  week in advance. [21]     I am satisfied that it is appropriate in these circumstances to order Ms. A  to pay a fine pursuant to s. 61(2)(g) in the amount of $10 payable forthwith.   [SUBMISSIONS ON COSTS] [22]     THE COURT: I appreciate that your client has some financial challenges.  I am satisfied, though, in this case that Mr. S has been largely  successful or very successful on this application and has established that your  client did wrongfully deny parenting time.  [23]     I am concerned that even after attempts to resolve this on Mr. S's  part by engaging with Ms. A that he was deprived of parenting time in  particular over the winter break when he might have had extra time during the  day, and that rather than bringing an application to vary the order, your  client unilaterally made decisions about parenting time. [24]     I am satisfied in these circumstances, given that Mr. S was put to  the expense of having to bring this application in order to get any parenting  time at all, that he is entitled to costs in any event of the cause. [25]     Again, as I have said in the order, that these terms in terms of the  make‑up time can be varied by consent in writing between the parties. I  am not precluding that, and I expect that Mr. S will continue in the way  that he has before in exercising his parenting time. That is my expectation. Mr. S  is entitled to compensatory weekend time starting this weekend, and he has  three make‑up weekends, which will be exercised consecutively over the  next six weeks, unless the parties agree otherwise in writing. “Lamb J.”"},"meta":{},"created_at":"2022-03-08T08:08:14.441089Z","updated_at":"2022-03-08T08:08:14.441103Z","project":2},{"id":50,"annotations":[{"id":56,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"start":3,"end":40,"text":"THE SUPREME COURT OF BRITISH COLUMBIA","labels":["COURT_NAME"]},"id":"3e2199fc-9","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":617,"end":646,"text":"Director of Civil  Forfeiture","labels":["PERS_APPELLANT"]},"id":"3e219a2e-9","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":745,"end":756,"text":"Dinh Hao Vu","labels":["PERS_RESPONDENT"]},"id":"3e219a56-9","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":6943,"end":6959,"text":"Justice Pearlman","labels":["PERS_JUDGE"]},"id":"3e219a88-9","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":776,"end":812,"text":"The Honourable Madam Justice Jackson","labels":["PERS_JUDGE"]},"id":"3e219aba-9","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":13386,"end":13399,"text":"Justice Leask","labels":["PERS_JUDGE"]},"id":"3e219ae2-9","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":950,"end":967,"text":"December 20, 2019","labels":["DATE_HEARING"]},"id":"3e219b28-9","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":1011,"end":1026,"text":"January 3, 2020","labels":["DATE_JUDGEMENT"]},"id":"3e219b5a-9","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":899,"end":907,"text":"A.

Vu,   2020 BCSC 106 Date: 20200103 Docket: S181868 Registry:  Victoria Civil  Forfeiture Action in Rem Against The  Lands and Structures situated at 6428 Bella Vista Drive,   Victoria, British Columbia and having a Legal Description of PID 015-120-341,  Lot 16, Plan VIP49441, Section 16, Range 4E, South Saanich Land District and its  fruits and proceeds, and $11,100.00 in Canadian currency seized by the CSPD  from 6428 Bella Vista Drive, Victoria, British Columbia on March 28, 2018, and  its proceeds Between: Director of Civil  Forfeiture Plaintiff And The Owners and all  Others Interested in the Property and\/or Money, in Particular,  Dinh Hao Vu Defendant Before:  The Honourable Madam Justice Jackson Oral Reasons for Judgment Counsel for Plaintiff: L. F. de Lima Counsel for Defendant: A. Huynh Place and Date of Hearing: Victoria, B.C. December 20, 2019 Place and Date of Judgment: Victoria, B.C. January 3, 2020   [1]     These are my reasons for judgment in this matter. If a transcript is  ordered I may make stylistic or grammatical changes but they will not affect  the substance of my reasons and decision. [2]     There are two applications before me for determination. [3]     In the first, Dinh Hao Vu (the “Applicant”) seeks an order pursuant to  Supreme  Court Civil Rules , B.C. Reg. 168\/2009, R. 12-5(67), that the question of  whether the Applicant’s rights under s. 8 of the  Canadian Charter of  Rights and Freedoms  have been violated as a result of the search and  seizure of the premises at 6428 Bella Vista Drive, Victoria, BC V8Z 7G6, and  the corresponding remedy for the alleged  Charter  breaches, be heard  prior to and separately from the remaining issues in the notice of civil claim  brought by the Director of Civil Forfeiture (the “Director”) (the “Bifurcation  Application”). [4]     If the Applicant is successful in the Bifurcation Application, the  Applicant seeks consequential further relief deferring examination for  discovery and document production until after the determination of the  Charter   issues, or in the alternative that such discovery be limited in scope to the  Charter   issues. If the Applicant is successful in his Bifurcation Application, the  Director does not oppose the consequential relief the Applicant seeks. [5]     If the Applicant is unsuccessful in the Bifurcation Application, in the  second application, the Director seeks disclosure and discovery orders against  the Applicant (the “Disclosure Application”). While not consenting to the  Director’s Disclosure Application, the Applicant concedes that if he is  unsuccessful in his Bifurcation Application there would be no basis not to  grant the relief the Director seeks.  [6]     For the purposes of the Bifurcation Application, the Director concedes  the Applicant had some reasonable expectation of privacy, and has standing to  bring his application. [7]     The Director challenges the admissibility of the evidence for three  reasons. [8]     The Director argues that both affidavits filed by the Applicant are  inadmissible because they contain no reference to the Applicant’s use of a  translator. At paragraph 10 of the Applicant’s affidavit made on July 8, 2019  (the “First Affidavit”), the Applicant deposes that: On March 31, 2018, I attended the  CSPS station, where Sergeant Haney interviewed me and my son was in attendance,  acting as the translator. I was told after the interview by my son that he  believes he did not accurately translate the statements made by Sergeant Haney.  Sergeant Haney also continued to ask questions after I requested that the  interview cease. [9]     The inference to be drawn from this paragraph is that the Applicant is  asserting he requires the assistance of an English language translator.  However, the First Affidavit as well as the Applicant’s affidavit made July 17,  2019 (the “Second Affidavit”), are in English. There is no reference in either  affidavit to any translator being used. When this apparent anomaly was raised  by counsel for the Director, counsel for the Applicant advised that she had  translated the First Affidavit and the Second Affidavit for the Applicant, contrary  to the requirement of  Supreme Court Civil Rules , R. 22-2(7). The  Director argues both affidavits are inadmissible on the basis that they do not  contain the required certification of a translator. The Director further argues  that, even if the affidavits had included the requisite certification of  translation, the Applicant’s counsel would not be considered an impartial  translator and the reliability that flows from the use of an independent  translator would be absent:  Luu v. Wang , 2011 BCSC 1201 at paras. 8-15.   [10]     Relying on R. 22-2(14), counsel for the Applicant argues the absence of  any indication that the affidavits were the product of a translation is simply  “an irregularity in its form” and that the affidavits should nonetheless be  admitted. [11]     I do not consider failing to provide any indication that the First  Affidavit and the Second Affidavit where the product of a translation to be a  mere “irregularity in its form”. This is particularly so where it appears that  the Applicant’s ability to speak and understand English could be a fact of some  significance in the proceedings. I consider the absence of information that the  affidavits were prepared based on a translation to be a serious breach of the  Rules .  In my view, neither of the affidavits are admissible. [12]     Given my conclusion that the First Affidavit and the Second Affidavit  are inadmissible on the basis that they violate the  Rules , specifically  those governing the requirements of translated affidavits, it is not necessary  for me to address the Director’s other two objections in detail. I will simply  state that I would also exclude the Applicant’s Second Affidavit on the basis  that it violates the rule against splitting one’s case, which applies even in  chambers applications where the respondent has not filed any affidavit  material, as was the case before me:  The Owners, Strata Plan KAS 2971 v.  American Bankers Insurance Company of Florida , 2016 BCSC 581 at paras. 28-31.  An applicant is obliged to present all of his evidence in support of an  application at the outset and cannot only partially present his evidence and  then attempt to fill in any evidentiary gaps identified in the respondent’s  application response with further affidavit evidence when the respondent has  filed no affidavit evidence to which the applicant can reply:  A.P. v. D.S. ,  [1998] B.C.J. No. 348 at para. 13;  Fast Trac Bobcat &  Excavating Service v. Riverfront Corporate Centre , 2008 BCSC 848 at para. 3.  Although the Applicant relies on  Woo v. ONNI Ioco Road Five Development  Limited Partnership , 2012 BCSC 1445, at para. 35 Justice Pearlman  refers to the affidavits to which objection had been taken, as “reply”  affidavits, which suggests to me responding affidavits had been filed. That is  distinguishable from the situation before me. The fact that the Applicant filed  the Bifurcation Application in an attempt to ameliorate the splitting of his  case after the issue was drawn to his attention by counsel for the Director,  does not alter my conclusion. In my view, it would be an abusive process to  permit the Applicant to proceed as he did. [13]     I would also accede to the Director’s argument that exhibits “D” and “E”  of the Applicant’s First Affidavit are inadmissible for the purpose of  establishing the distance between the Property and another house. Exhibits “D”  and “E” are two pages which bear the Google trademark, show a map of some type,  are largely illegible, include information which is inconsistent with the  submissions made on behalf of the Applicant, are undated and include no legend  to even partially explain the information the pages contain. There is not even  any evidence from the Applicant in the body of the affidavit that attempts to  explain or interpret the information the documents are alleged to provide.  Exhibits “D” and “E” provide no reliable probative evidence:  R. v. Quiring ,  2019 SKQB 125 at paras. 22-29. I would rule them inadmissible on that  basis as well. [14]     Given my ruling that the Applicant’s First Affidavit and Second  Affidavit are inadmissible, and there being no other evidence before the Court,  it follows that the Bifurcation Application must be dismissed. However, in the  event that I am wrong regarding the admissibility of the affidavit evidence, I  will nonetheless address the merits of the Applicant’s Bifurcation Application. [15]     As a starting point, the presumption is that “all claims should be  brought and adjudicated at one time”:  Brennand v. Sun Life Assurance Company  of Canada , 2011 BCSC 759 at para. 22. [16]     However, the court has the discretion to order bifurcation where there  are extraordinary, exceptional or compelling reasons to bifurcate or a real  likelihood of significant savings in time or expense:  Civil Forfeiture  (Director) v. Johnson , 2015 BCSC 1217 at para. 53;  Director of  Civil Forfeiture v. Huynh , 2012 BCSC 740 at para. 24, citing  Bramwell  v. Greater Vancouver Transportation Authority , 2008 BCSC 1180 at paras. 11-12;   British Columbia (Civil Forfeiture) v. Liu , 2019 BCSC 779 at para. 6.  It is the second prong of this test on which the Applicant relies. See  Huynh   at para. 25;  Liu  at para. 27. [17]     The test for review of a search warrant is “whether there was reliable evidence  that might reasonably be believed on the basis of which the authorization could  have issued, not whether in the opinion of the reviewing judge, the application  should have been granted at all by the authorizing judge” (emphasis in  original):  R. v. Araujo , 2000 SCC 65 at para. 54. On this  Bifurcation Application, “I am required to assess, to a very limited extent and  taking care not to embarrass the trial judge in his or her ultimate analysis,  the likelihood that the evidence of the search will be excluded and the effect  that such exclusion would have on the continuation of the action”:  Huynh   at para. 25. In other words, given my consideration is a preliminary  assessment of the Applicant’s argument regarding the alleged breach of his  s. 8  Charter  rights, I am to undertake a very limited review of the  evidence and determine whether there is a “real likelihood” the trial judge  would: 1)   find the  information to obtain the warrant (“ITO”), as amplified if appropriate, could  not provide “reasonable grounds to believe” (being the standard set out in  s. 11(1) of the  Controlled Drugs and Substances Act , S.C. 1996,  c. 19) an offence had been committed and that evidence was to be found at  the residence; and  2)   exclude the  evidence obtained in the search. [18]     Review of the warrant begins from the presumption of validity:  R. v.  Sadikov , 2014 ONCA 72 at para. 83.  [19]     The Applicant submits that “no justice acting judicially could have  granted the search warrant in this case had the justice known all the facts  known to the affiant who swore the ITO at the time it was sworn, and had not  been materially misled by some of the information presented in the ITO.” [20]     Relying on  R. v. Garofoli , [1990] 2 S.C.R. 1421;  R. v. Araujo ;   R. v. Morelli , 2010 SCC 8;  R. v. Campbell , 2011 SCC 32, the  Applicant argues that a number of pieces of information in the ITO were  misleading (or, in the words of counsel for the Applicant, “potentially”  misleading) and some pieces of information were omitted from the ITO, which  should not have been, and which represent a failure to make full and frank  disclosure. The Applicant argues it is “in the interests of justice” to  bifurcate the proceeding and try the  Charter  issues first:  British  Columbia (Director of Civil Forfeiture) v. Cronin , 2016 BCSC 284 at para. 37.  He argues doing so “may result in dismissal of the [Director’s] claims, should  the  Charter  breaches be proven.”  [21]     As my assessment at this preliminary stage is to be very limited, I will  not make extensive comments with respect to the specific complaints of the  Applicant with respect to the ITO. Rather, I will simply set out general  principles which I view as responsive to the concerns the Applicant raised. [22]     First, an ITO must be viewed holistically and in its entirety, and not  considered word by word or line by line in isolation:  R. v. Rossiter ,  2006 BCPC 306, [2006] B.C.J No. 1488 at paras. 18, 20, citing  HMTQ  v. Maxwell , 2004 BCSC 1200 at paras. 34-35;  R. v. Beren and Swallow ,  2005 BCSC 1633 at para. 46.  [23]     Hearsay can be relied on to support a belief there are reasonable  grounds to issue a warrant:  R. v. Montgomery , 2016 BCCA 379 at para. 123.   [24]     The affiant of an ITO is entitled to draw and articulate reasonable  inferences based on articulated facts:  R. v. Nguyen , 2014 ONSC 4230 at para. 41. [25]     Expert evidence is not required to understand Hydro electrical data or  draw inferences from it:  Nguyen  at paras. 55, 83, 88. I do not read   R. v. Gauthier and Pleice , 2012 BCSC 2233, as being inconsistent with  that statement of the law. In Gauthier it appears that Justice Leask’s concern  was that the affiant of the ITO provided an expert opinion about Hydro  requirements of indoor cannabis marijuana grow operations without a basis for  an expertise being articulated in the ITO. The Hydro information in the ITO in  this case dealt with household consumption which is a matter within the common  knowledge of a trier of fact and does not require expert opinion evidence.  Further, the affiant of the ITO in this case articulated the basis for the  knowledge of the Hydro information provided. Counsel for the Director brought  to my attention the decision of the British Columbia Court of Appeal in  R.  v. Dellapenna,  [1995] B.C.J. No. 1526 (C.A.). However, I agree with  him that there is a basis upon which it can be distinguished from the  circumstances of this case. In  Dellapenna , it appears the Court’s  concern was that the affiant of the ITO had stated his opinion without setting  out its foundation, and on review the foundation was tenuous (at paras. 16,  35).  [26]     Finally, a failure to make full and frank disclosure, without more, does  not invalidate a warrant:  R. v. Frederickson , 2018 BCCA 2 at para. 31.  By making this comment I do not wish to be understood as suggesting there was a  failure to make full and frank disclosure in the ITO. [27]     Assuming the amplified record for which the Applicant advocates,  excising some information and adding others, I am not satisfied the there is a  real likelihood the trial judge would find the warrant could not have issued.  In addition, the Applicant made no submissions in support of any argument that  there is a real likelihood the trial judge would exclude evidence that resulted  from a breach of the Applicant’s s. 8  Charter  rights.  [28]     In all the circumstances, I am unable to conclude there is a real  likelihood bifurcation could resolve the case, thereby saving substantial time  and expense. I would therefore decline to exercise my discretion to bifurcate  the proceedings as requested by the Applicant.  [29]     For all of the above reasons the Applicant’s Bifurcation Application is  dismissed. [30]     As noted earlier in these reasons, counsel for the Applicant  acknowledged that if the Bifurcation Application was unsuccessful there was no  basis not to grant the relief sought by the Director in the Disclosure  Application. I am satisfied the order sought with respect to an amended list of  documents, as set out in paragraph 1 of the Disclosure Application is warranted  and appropriate. The order sought in the Director’s Disclosure Application is  granted on the terms set out therein.  [31]     The Director was the successful party in both applications. Costs are  payable by the Applicant to the Director. “Jackson  J.”"},"meta":{},"created_at":"2022-03-08T08:08:14.440959Z","updated_at":"2022-03-08T08:08:14.440973Z","project":2},{"id":49,"annotations":[{"id":55,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"start":0,"end":36,"text":"COURT OF APPEAL FOR BRITISH COLUMBIA","labels":["COURT_NAME"]},"id":"3e21b3c4-9","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":122,"end":134,"text":"Vitto Chiodo","labels":["PERS_APPELLANT"]},"id":"3e21b41e-9","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":140,"end":153,"text":"Leanne Chiodo","labels":["PERS_APPELLANT"]},"id":"3e21b46e-9","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":182,"end":190,"text":"John Doe","labels":["PERS_RESPONDENT"]},"id":"3e21b4a0-9","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":199,"end":207,"text":"Jane Doe","labels":["PERS_RESPONDENT"]},"id":"3e21b4d2-9","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":250,"end":260,"text":"Tia Collis","labels":["PERS_RESPONDENT"]},"id":"3e21b504-9","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":334,"end":371,"text":"The Honourable Madam Justice Saunders","labels":["PERS_JUDGE"]},"id":"3e21b536-9","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":372,"end":407,"text":"The Honourable Madam Justice Fenlon","labels":["PERS_JUDGE"]},"id":"3e21b55e-9","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":408,"end":441,"text":"The Honourable Mr. Justice Grauer","labels":["PERS_JUDGE"]},"id":"3e21b590-9","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":471,"end":508,"text":"the Supreme Court of British Columbia","labels":["COURT_NAME"]},"id":"3e21b5c2-9","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":612,"end":624,"text":"A.M.

Brown Place and Date of Hearing: Vancouver, British   Columbia October 22, 2021 Place and Date of Judgment: Vancouver, British   Columbia January 31, 2022   Written Reasons by: The Honourable Madam Justice Fenlon Concurred in by: The Honourable Madam Justice Saunders The Honourable Mr. Justice Grauer Summary: The appellants appeal from a  decision dismissing their application for judicial review of an arbitrator’s  decision refusing to set aside a notice to end their tenancy. They say the  judge erred in: dismissing the petition for delay, concluding in the  alternative that the arbitrator’s findings were reasonable, and failing to  consider whether the owner had obtained the requisite permits prior to  delivering the notice to end tenancy. Held: Appeal dismissed. The judge  considered the relevant factors in deciding whether a judicial review petition  should be dismissed for unreasonable delay and was alive to the potential  prejudice to the appellants.   Reasons for Judgment of the  Honourable Madam Justice Fenlon: [1]     For more than 18 years the appellants, Vitto and Leanne Chiodo,  rented a mobile home pad from the respondent, Princess Enterprises, which  operates the “Shady Rest” mobile home park on Westbank First Nation’s reserve  land on the shores of Lake Okanagan. They used the mobile home as their  vacation property. Unfortunately for the appellants, Princess decided it needed  their lot to access a well adjacent to the property to irrigate the park and  delivered a notice to end tenancy. The Chiodos in turn delivered a notice to  arbitrate, contending that Princess was not acting in good faith and had not  complied with a Westbank First Nation law requiring them to obtain all  necessary project permits before ending a tenancy. The notice to end tenancy was  upheld at arbitration and the appellants failed to overturn that decision on judicial  review. [2]     The appellants contend the reviewing judge erred by: 1. dismissing their  judicial review petition for delay; 2. concluding in the  alternative that the arbitrator’s finding that Princess had terminated the  tenancy in good faith was reasonable; and 3. not considering  whether Princess had obtained all permits and approvals before delivering the  notice to end tenancy. [3]     The first ground of appeal involves a discretionary decision made at  first instance by the reviewing judge and is reviewable on a deferential  standard. In addressing the second and third grounds of appeal, this Court  steps into the shoes of the reviewing judge and applies the appropriate  standard of review to the arbitrator’s decision. [4]     Princess served the notice to end tenancy on January 2, 2018, to  take effect on January 3, 2019. The Chiodos were understandably distressed  by the termination notice. They had done work on the mobile home, had spent summers  there for more than 18 years, and intended to use the premises as their  retirement home. The Chiodos described their lot as a prime location with 150 feet  of beachfront. They applied to an arbitrator under s. 52.1 of the Westbank  First Nation Residential Premises Law No. 2008‑03,  A Law to  Regulate Residential Premises on Westbank Lands  (22 March 2010) [ RPL ],  which provides: 52.1 A tenant may apply to an  arbitrator for an order setting aside a notice of the end of the tenancy  agreement given or purportedly given under this Law. [5]     An arbitrator dismissed the arbitration on March 16, 2018, but that  initial arbitration decision was overturned on judicial review by Justice  Horsman. Although the Chiodos had waited four months before filing for review, Horsman J.  declined to dismiss the petition for unreasonable delay given the importance of  the matter to the Chiodos. She concluded the arbitrator had erroneously treated  an amended notice to arbitrate as a new notice falling outside the filing  deadline and had improperly dismissed the arbitration for delay. In remitting  the matter for arbitration on the merits, Horsman J. reminded the parties  of the importance of an expeditious process and of her expectation that there  should be no delay in scheduling a new arbitration hearing: 2018 BCSC 2078  at para. 62. [6]     The second arbitration—the one underlying this appeal—was heard by  arbitrator Tia Collis on January 23, 2019. On March 18, 2019, she  upheld the notice to end tenancy, finding that Princess had acted in good faith  and had not failed to obtain necessary permits. On the latter point, Arbitrator  Collis concluded Princess did not need a well license under the  Water  Sustainability Act , S.B.C. 2014, c. 15 [ WSA ] to operate the  well. [7]     Somewhat surprisingly, given their previous experience with an  application to dismiss for delay and Horsman J.’s admonition to proceed  expeditiously, the Chiodos did not apply for leave to review Arbitrator Collis’  decision within the 15‑day time limit in the  RPL . Their  application for leave to review the arbitration decision was declined on the  basis that it had been filed 44 days after the decision—29 days late. The Chiodos  then waited a further eight months before filing the petition for judicial  review. [8]     The reviewing judge noted that, at common law, the court has discretion  to deny judicial review remedies on the basis of undue delay, a discretion that  has been preserved by s. 8(1) of the  Judicial Review Procedure Act ,  R.S.B.C. 1996, c. 241:  Housewise Construction Ltd. v. Whitgift Holdings Ltd.,   2016 BCSC 2245. She instructed herself on the factors to be considered  in deciding whether a judicial review petition should be dismissed for  unreasonable delay as set out in  Lowe v. Diebolt,  2014 BCCA 280 at para. 46: 1. How does the underlying  administrative scheme operate and what are its objectives?  2. To what extent might  those objectives be undermined by delay? 3. Is the issue brought  forward on the judicial review of critical importance to one or the other  party? 4. Will the delay result  in hardship, prejudice or injustice? 5. What is the effect  of proceeding with judicial review or terminating it on the proper functioning  of the administrative regime? [9]     In addressing the nature of the underlying administrative regime, the  judge noted the short deadlines contained in the  RPL  dispute resolution  process. She found that Westbank First Nation’s success in its real estate  endeavours and in managing its lands was in large part due to an effective and  economical dispute resolution process. She accepted that certainty and finality  were critical values underlying Westbank First Nation’s residential tenancy  legal framework. [10]     The judge addressed the interests of the parties, hardship, and  prejudice collectively, concluding: [47] In all the circumstances,  I do not find that the  petitioners have provided a compelling explanation for the significant delay in  bringing their petition for judicial review . In light of the evidence  provided by WFN about the importance of clarity and certainty to WFN’s ability  to manage its land for the benefit of members and non‑member residents  alike, I find that  this is a case where the proper functioning of the  administrative regime weighs heavily . To countenance a complete abandonment  of the timely dispute resolution process set out in the  RPL  would  undermine the proper functioning of this administrative scheme. [Emphasis added.] [11]     Westbank First Nation was granted intervenor status in this appeal to  address the dispute resolution framework. It stressed the importance of the  strict timelines to achieving legal and commercial certainty for all involved—tenants,  landlords, and the Frist Nation itself. [12]     The appellants submit the judge erred because she focused almost  exclusively on the prejudice to Princess and the functioning of the Westbank  First Nation’s administrative regime and did not consider the prejudice to the Chiodos  in dismissing their petition because of delay. They contend this was a  mandatory and significant consideration in the delay assessment and that the  judge’s failure to engage in a detailed analysis of potential prejudice to the Chiodos—from  dismissing what might be a meritorious judicial review—constitutes a clear  error of law. [13]     I would not accede to this argument. Although the judge did not  expressly describe the nature of the prejudice to the appellants, this was a  case in which the prejudice was obvious, driving as it did the entire legal  proceeding. The appellants were fighting the notice to end tenancy because they  were about to lose a vacation home they had enjoyed for more than 18 years. [14]     In addition, at para. 42 of her reasons, the judge referred to that  part of Horsman J.’s reasons on the earlier judicial review in which she  addressed prejudice to the appellant. In part, Horsman J. had stated: [41] First, this petition  is of obvious importance to the Petitioners who risk losing the vacation home  they have had for over 18 years, and simply seek a hearing of the merits  of their dispute of the Notice before the tenancy terminates. It would work a  significant unfairness to the Petitioners to dismiss a meritorious application  for judicial review on the basis of a delay that cannot be characterized as  inordinate. [15]     A judge is not required to describe every step in their reasoning  process; it is sufficient if the basis for a decision is discernible from the  reasons read in the context of the record:  R. v. R.E.M ., 2008  SCC 51 at para. 24. In my view, the judge’s reasons demonstrate that  she was alive to, and weighed, the prejudice to the appellants if the judicial  review was dismissed for delay, but found it was insufficient to offset the  countervailing consideration of eight month’s delay—a delay she found the  appellants had failed to explain. [16]     Nor do I agree with the appellants’ submission that the judge  misunderstood their explanation for the delay. In his affidavit filed in  support of the petition, Mr. Chiodo said he “did not want to go to the  expense and inconvenience of making a [judicial review] application if in fact  Princess obtained a well license” and that “[in] order to make that  determination it was necessary to … try to determine the status of the well  application”. He stated that his lawyer at the time informed him that he had  made “telephone inquiries on February 4, 2020 [and] … the well license  application … was not approved.” [17]     The judge understood Mr. Chiodo’s evidence to be that he was told  on February 4 that the license application was not  yet  approved,  questioning how “ the current status of any applications  by [Princess],  as revealed by an FOI request would … in any way alleviate [the Chiodos’]  stated concern that, if [Princess was] found to require a permit [under the  WSA ] , [Princess] could simply apply for a permit  and then start the eviction process all over again” (emphasis added): at para. 46. [18]     The appellants submit the judge failed to appreciate that Princess’  application for a permit had been  denied , so erroneously reasoned that  it was still open to Princess to apply for and obtain a permit if one was found  to be required. The appellants contend that if the judge had appreciated that  Princess’ application for a permit under the  WSA  had been rejected, and  that they had filed their petition one week after learning this, “the Decision  may well have been different … the Chambers Judge’s reasons for being  dissatisfied with the Chiodos’ explanation would have fallen away.” [19]     With respect, it appears to be the appellants who have misapprehended  the record. Mr. Chiodo’s affidavit does not say that his lawyer told him Princess’  application had been denied. He states only that he was told it “was not  approved.” The manager for the mobile home park, Mr. Osberg, provided  direct evidence in his affidavit sworn March 9, 2020, responding to Mr. Chiodo’s  affidavit, and in support of Princess’ response to the petition for judicial  review, deposed that a determination  had not yet been made  on the  application. [20]     It was thus open to the judge to conclude that all Mr. Chiodo learned  on February 4 was that the  WSA  permit had not yet been approved. I  see no error in the judge’s understanding of Mr. Chiodo’s explanation for  the delay in filing for judicial review, nor do I see any error in her  conclusion that the explanation was inadequate. [21]     I note as well that the arbitrator concluded Princess did not need a  WSA   permit, both because the  WSA  provided for a permit‑free three‑year  transition period, and because of the inapplicability of the  WSA  to  reserve lands. Even if Princess’ application had been denied, the arbitrator’s conclusion  that a  WSA  permit was  not  required would have to be challenged  before Princess’s inability to obtain a permit could have any relevance to the  validity of the notice to end tenancy. [22]     In conclusion, I see no basis upon which this Court could interfere with  the judge’s exercise of her discretion to dismiss the judicial review for  unreasonable delay. [23]     Having come to that conclusion, it is not necessary to address the  second and third grounds of appeal. For the benefit of Mr. and Ms. Chiodo,  however, I will consider these grounds briefly. [24]     In my view, the arbitrator’s conclusions that Princess issued the notice  to end tenancy in good faith, and that a permit was not required under the  WSA ,  were reasonable ones. This was not a case in which the appellants put forward conflicting  evidence on the good faith issue; they simply challenged Princess’ reasons for  wanting to take over their lot, suggesting they were illogical, and that  Princess really wanted to rent the premises to someone else. The arbitrator correctly  identified the law on good faith. She reviewed Princess’ evidence and its  reasons for developing the well and found them to be credible. The arbitrator  therefore found Princess had acted in good faith. In the context of this case, the  judge’s reasons were sufficient and were not conclusory. [25]     As for the third ground of appeal—that the arbitrator’s decision should  be quashed because she did not consider whether permits other than the  WSA   license had to be obtained before the notice to end tenancy could be issued—those  matters were not argued before the arbitrator, and her decision cannot  therefore be found to be unreasonable for failing to consider them. As this Court  observed in  Vandale v. Workers’ Compensation Appeal Tribunal , 2013 BCCA 391: [54] … To allow a party a  new hearing before an administrative tribunal because it overlooked raising an  issue or making an argument at the original hearing would unduly interfere with  the role entrusted to such tribunals:  Alberta Teachers’ Association  at para. 24.  In effect, the tribunal’s decision would be set aside not because it failed to  pass scrutiny under the applicable standard of review, but because it did not  address a point it was not asked to address. [26]     A judge on judicial review has discretion to entertain new arguments but  generally will not do so if the issue could have been, but was not, raised  before the tribunal:  Alberta (Information and Privacy Commissioner) v.  Alberta Teachers’ Association , 2011 SCC 61 at para. 23. I note  that quite apart from the limited role of a reviewing court in administrative  matters, which militates against addressing new issues, the respondent in this  case would be prejudiced if that course were followed. The environmental  assessment framework the appellants wish to rely on would require factual  context to resolve—context that was not addressed at the arbitration. [27]     In conclusion, I would dismiss the appeal with costs to Princess  Enterprises. No award of costs is made either for or against the intervenor. “The  Honourable Madam Justice Fenlon” I AGREE: “The Honourable Madam Justice  Saunders” I AGREE: “The Honourable Mr. Justice  Grauer”"},"meta":{},"created_at":"2022-03-08T08:08:14.440808Z","updated_at":"2022-03-08T08:08:14.440822Z","project":2},{"id":48,"annotations":[{"id":54,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"start":3,"end":40,"text":"THE SUPREME COURT OF BRITISH COLUMBIA","labels":["COURT_NAME"]},"id":"3e21c86e-9","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":163,"end":175,"text":"Kevin Farren","labels":["PERS_APPELLANT"]},"id":"3e21c8a0-9","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":190,"end":215,"text":"Elite Service  Group Inc.","labels":["PERS_RESPONDENT"]},"id":"3e21c8d2-9","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":235,"end":262,"text":"The Honourable Justice Iyer","labels":["PERS_JUDGE"]},"id":"3e21c904-9","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":320,"end":329,"text":"K.

Elite Service Group Inc.,   2020 BCSC 23 Date: 20200109 Docket: S188534 Registry:  Vancouver Between: Kevin Farren Plaintiff And Elite Service  Group Inc. Defendant Before:  The Honourable Justice Iyer Reasons for Judgment The Plaintiff, Appearing in Person: K. Farren Counsel for Defendant: C.R. Wardell Place and Date of Trial: Vancouver, B.C. December 13, 2019 Place and Date of Judgment: Vancouver, B.C. January 9, 2020   [1]     In August 2018, Mr. Farren commenced a wrongful dismissal action against  Elite Service Group Inc. (“Elite”). Elite now applies for a summary trial on  the issue of whether Mr. Farren is an employee, as he claims, or an independent  contractor, as Elite maintains.  [2]     Elite is a maintenance and repair company. It contracts with the  Starbucks coffee chain to maintain and repair its approximately 1200 Canadian  stores. Its BC office provides these services to approximately 200 stores in  the Vancouver area. The BC office has two employees: an operations manager and  a warehouseman. They work closely with Elite’s main office in Mississauga,  Ontario, which has seven employees.  [3]     Elite’s main services are signage, cleaning and “handy work”, which I  understand to be general maintenance and repair. It contracts with workers to  perform those functions and has approximately 53 such contracts across Canada,  one of which is with Mr. Farren. [4]     Mr. Farren and Elite entered into an oral contract to provide handy work  services commencing January 1, 2018. His contract was terminated without notice  on April 25, 2018, giving rise to the present dispute. [5]     Mr. Farren did not file any response to the present application.  Instead, he asked for an adjournment at the outset of the hearing, saying that  he required more time to get a lawyer and that he had not received the  application materials because they were sent to a defunct email address.  [6]     In fact, Mr. Farren’s previous lawyer withdrew some 11 months ago. The  application materials were sent to Mr. Farren in October at the email address  stipulated as his address for service in an order of this court on January 11,  2019. It is not clear whether Mr. Farren’s email address for service was  defunct at that time, as he appeared in court with the relevant materials. I  denied the adjournment, explaining to Mr. Farren that it is his responsibility  to update his address for service if it changes and that he had had ample time  to find a lawyer.  [7]     The two issues in this application are whether the issue is suitable for  summary trial and, if so, whether Mr. Farren’s relationship with Elite was that  of an employee or an independent contractor. [8]     Before proceeding by summary trial under Rule 9-7, the court must decide  whether the matter is suitable for disposition by summary trial. That is a  discretionary decision. Generally, where the issue(s) can be decided on the  evidence before the court, a summary trial serves the objectives of fair,  speedy and inexpensive determination of the proceeding on its merits: see for  example  Stewart (District) v. Stewart Harbour Authority , 2004 BCSC 8. [9]     As Elite points out, determining the nature of Mr. Farren’s relationship  with Elite will either end the proceedings or substantially simplify the issues  for trial. As Mr. Farren tendered no evidence, there is no conflicting evidence  that might require an assessment of credibility. I find that the issue is  suitable for determination by summary trial. [10]     If Mr. Farren was an employee of Elite, the law of wrongful dismissal would  govern the termination of his employment. In that case, he would be entitled to  reasonable notice of termination or damages in lieu of such notice. The  appropriate remedy would have to be determined in a subsequent proceeding.  However, if Mr. Farren is an independent contractor, he is not entitled to  the remedies he seeks. In that case, his claim should be dismissed: see  Jacks  v. Victoria Amateur Swimming Club,  2005 BCSC 778.  [11]     Recently, in  Lightstream Telecommunications Inc. v. Telecon Inc. ,  2018 BCSC 1940, this court set out a useful list of factors to determine  whether a worker is an independent contractor, based on a review of relevant  case law. Justice Russell grouped the factors as follows (at paras. 124-159) : a)     Level of worker control, including: (1)     Defendant’s control over plaintiff’s activities, including: (a)     Defendant’s power to select or not select the worker, (b)     Payment of wages, (c)     Defendant’s control over method of work, and  (d)     Defendant’s right to suspend or dismiss plaintiff; (2)     Exclusive nature of the relationship; (3)     Plaintiff’s economic dependence on defendant; and (4)     Whether plaintiff could hire their own helpers. b)     Ownership of equipment or tools; c)     Opportunity for profit\/loss; d)     Business integration, including: (1)     whether the plaintiff was a crucial element of the defendant’s business, (2)     whether the activity of the worker represents the defendant’s business, (3)     permanency and length of the relationship; and (4)     whether the parties rely on each other or closely co-ordinate conduct [12]     I will apply these factors to the evidence before me. [13]     With respect to worker selection, Elite assigns work to workers such as  Mr. Farren (called “Vendors”). Assignments specify the type of work, the  location and the timeframe for completion, usually between 24 hours or five  days. Vendors may accept the assignment, decline it, or request changes. Elite will  then either assign the work to a different Vendor or make the requested change.  Therefore, Elite had a limited power to select Mr. Farren for work. I find that  this sub-factor is neutral.  [14]     With respect to payment of wages, Mr. Farren invoiced through his  company, “101” on its letterhead upon completion of assignments. Like other  Vendors, he charged Elite GST. Elite pays Vendor invoices monthly and does not  make any deductions or remittances from those amounts, such as income tax, CPP,  EI or workers’ compensation. Mr. Farren\/101 was Elite’s primary Vendor for  about 20 Starbucks stores in BC and Alberta. Mr. Farren\/101 invoiced at rates  set by Elite for labour and specified materials. This method of payment is  characteristic of an independent contractor rather than an employment  relationship. [15]     There is no evidence that Elite trained Mr. Farren to any significant  degree. It provided him with a tablet computer with invoicing software, and a  master key to access Starbucks stores after hours. Jenn Heppner-Palmer, Elite’s  Vancouver operations manager, accompanied Mr. Farren on an initial maintenance  walk-through. She also accompanied Mr. Farren on his first assignment. Other  than that, Mr. Farren performed the work using his pre-existing skill and  expertise. At times, Elite asked Vendors to provide an estimate of the time  and\/or cost for completing an assignment. Mr. Farren\/101 provided such  estimates.  [16]     Beyond specifying the nature of the work in the work assignment, Elite  exercises little control over how Vendors accomplish their assigned tasks.  Vendors are free to determine when they complete the work within the specified  time range. There is no evidence to support Mr. Farren’s assertion that Ms.  Heppner-Palmer “worked alongside” him. Ms. Heppner-Palmer’s evidence was that  she did not oversee Mr. Farren’s work, but that they would communicate  frequently by phone and text. This sub-factor also points to an independent  contractor relationship. [17]     Elite had the right to terminate Mr. Farren\/101’s services and did so on  April 24 or 25, 2019, as a result of a customer complaint. This sub-factor is  neutral. [18]     Elite’s evidence was that Mr. Farren\/101 was its primary vendor in the  Vancouver area for the four months he worked with Elite. Elite’s uncontested  evidence was that the relationship was not exclusive and Mr. Farren was free to  take on other work. There is no evidence about whether Mr. Farren took on such  work because he has failed to respond to demands for document disclosure and  requests arising from his discovery. That, coupled with Mr. Farren’s failure to  adduce any evidence about the exclusivity of the relationship, leads me to  conclude that the relationship was not exclusive. [19]     The determination of Mr. Farren’s level of economic dependency on Elite  is also hampered by the lack of evidence from Mr. Farren. Elite’s evidence  shows that Mr. Farren\/101 issued approximately 109 invoices to Elite for the  roughly four-month period from January-April 2018, for a total of $18,960,  including GST. Mr. Farren produced an invoice for each assignment. Elite paid  these invoices twice a month. The amounts varied. For example, Mr. Farren’s  invoices for February 2018 totalled $4,883.48 and his invoices for April 2018  totalled $6,618.97. [20]     Mr. Farren submitted that the amount of these invoices establishes his  economic dependence on Elite. I do not agree. Without any evidence about typical  levels of remuneration for this type of work or of Mr. Farren’s financial  circumstances, it is not reasonable to find that Mr. Farren was economically  dependent on Elite in the way an employee is economically dependant on an  employer. [21]     Mr. Farren could and did hire helpers to assist in performing services  for Elite. The evidence shows that Mr. Farren hired a few such individuals,  including his son. Mr. Farren did not separately itemize hours of labour  performed by each individual on his invoices; he simply invoiced Elite for the  total amount of labour performed. I reject Mr. Farren’s assertion that these  individuals were hired by Elite: there is no evidence of this. What evidence  there is, including Mr. Farren’s texts referring to these individuals as “his”  workers, demonstrates that they were not connected to Elite. [22]     In conclusion, the factors relating to the level worker control strongly  point to Mr. Farren being an independent contractor of Elite, not its employee.  While Elite set the rates and defined most job assignments, Mr. Farren was free  to decline them and to stipulate changes. He provided estimates and determined  his own work schedule within timeframes he agreed to with Elite. Elite provided  little training. Mr. Farren\/101 invoiced upon completion of each job and  was paid without the usual employee deductions and remittances. There is no  evidence that Mr. Farren was economically dependant on Elite, or that their  relationship was exclusive. Finally, there is evidence that Mr. Farren hired others  and treated them as his own workers. [23]     Apart from a tablet computer and an access card\/master key, there is no  evidence that Elite provided any equipment or tools to Mr. Farren. As reflected  in 101’s invoices, Mr. Farren provided his own truck. The invoiced charge for  “truck” appears to include a number of other supplies, such as “Tools –  Sanitary - Drywall tape – Mud – Cloth – Clean up”. This demonstrates that Mr.  Farren used some of his own tools and materials.  [24]     Mr. Farren submitted that Elite supplied all materials, such as tiling.  There is no evidence to this effect. Even assuming that Starbucks, through  Elite, would provide certain materials to maintain the consistent look of its  stores, there is no evidence that anyone other than Mr. Farren provided the  tools to perform the work. This factor also points towards an independent  contractor relationship. [25]     In addition, the nature of the relationship between Mr. Farren and Elite  provided Mr. Farren with some opportunities for profit and loss. Although the  evidence is not comprehensive, it appears that Mr. Farren\/101 was paid fixed  rates for certain routine types of work. For example, there was a set minimum  payment for a “walk-through”. If Mr. Farren could do that work in less than the  minimum time, he would be free to do other things, including other work. Mr.  Farren could and did hire others to do certain work. If he paid them less than  the hourly labour rate he billed to Elite, he could profit. Finally, if Mr.  Farren paid less for material charged to Elite at set rates (for example, the  rate for silicone was $14.00), he could profit. While these amounts might be  small, such opportunities for profit are characteristic of an independent  contractor relationship. [26]     The evidence shows that Mr. Farren was not crucial to Elite’s business. Elite  operates across Canada, servicing around 1200 Starbucks stores. Mr. Farren was  one of 17 handymen, with primary responsibility for handy work on about 20  stores. Elite had others who did the same work as he. He was not irreplaceable  and there is no evidence that his removal materially affected Elite’s  operations.  [27]     Mr. Farren’s activities did not represent Elite’s business in any public  way. He did not wear a uniform or display any other material demonstrating a  relationship to Elite.  [28]     There is no evidence about how long the relationship was intended to  last. In fact, it lasted only four months. [29]     Although there is evidence of communication between Elite and Mr.  Farren, this kind of communication does not amount to coordination in the sense  required by this sub-factor. Ms. Heppner-Palmer deposed that she communicated  with Mr. Farren frequently about potential jobs, as well as his  availability and his progress on any outstanding work. Elite required certain  work to be done within certain time frames. However, it did not rely on Mr.  Farren’s work as part of a wider integrated work process, requiring close  coordination. For example, Elite was not relying on Mr. Farren to complete  a prototype that Elite would then manufacture. Rather, the maintenance and  repair work he performed was routine and repetitive. Beyond needing someone to  perform it in order to fulfil its contract with Starbucks, Elite did not place  any reliance on Mr. Farren or closely coordinate its activities with his. [30]     In summary, there was very little integration of Mr. Farren into Elite’s  business. This factor also points to Mr. Farren being an independent  contractor. [31]     I find that Mr. Farren\/101 was an independent contractor in relation to  Elite. Each of the four factors of level of worker control, ownership of  equipment and tools, profit\/loss opportunity and business integration support  that conclusion. Considered together, no other conclusion is possible on the  evidence presented. [32]     Elite’s application for summary trial is granted. I find that Mr. Farren  was an independent contractor during the time he provided service to Elite. Mr.  Farren’s action S-188534 against Elite is dismissed, with costs to Elite. “Iyer  J.”"},"meta":{},"created_at":"2022-03-08T08:08:14.440635Z","updated_at":"2022-03-08T08:08:14.440650Z","project":2},{"id":46,"annotations":[{"id":52,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"start":0,"end":36,"text":"COURT OF APPEAL FOR BRITISH COLUMBIA","labels":["COURT_NAME"]},"id":"3e21fc3a-9","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":149,"end":176,"text":"Nicole Christine  Henderson","labels":["PERS_APPELLANT"]},"id":"3e21fc76-9","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":203,"end":215,"text":"Gulzar Mawji","labels":["PERS_RESPONDENT"]},"id":"3e21fca8-9","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":272,"end":296,"text":"Nicole Christine  Csurdi","labels":["PERS_APPELLANT"]},"id":"3e21fcd0-9","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":323,"end":337,"text":"Katelyn Bannon","labels":["PERS_RESPONDENT"]},"id":"3e21fd02-9","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":369,"end":404,"text":"The Honourable Madam Justice Garson","labels":["PERS_JUDGE"]},"id":"3e21fd34-9","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":448,"end":485,"text":"the Supreme Court of British Columbia","labels":["COURT_NAME"]},"id":"3e21fd66-9","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":651,"end":663,"text":"T.P.

Bannon , 2019 BCSC 2280, New Westminster   Dockets M193837 and M172624). Oral Reasons for Judgment   Counsel for the Appellant: T.P. Harding Counsel for the Respondents: D.J. Sinnott Place and Date of Hearing: Vancouver, British   Columbia January 8, 2020 Place and Date of Judgment: Vancouver, British   Columbia January 13, 2020   Summary: The appellant applies to  extend time to serve notices of appeal in two related actions. Held:  Applications dismissed. The appellant concedes that the only point of the  appeal is to argue that an evidentiary ruling from the trial below should not  bind a new trial. However, previous evidentiary rulings do not bind new trials.  As a result, the proposed appeal lacks merit.  [1]     GARSON J.A. : These are applications before a single justice in  chambers to extend time to serve notices of appeal in two related actions. The  notices of appeal were served four days late. [2]     The appellant in both actions is the same person. She now uses the name  Nicole Christine Henderson. [3]     The criteria that govern this application to extend time pursuant to  s. 10(2)(d) of the  Court of Appeal Act,  R.S.B.C. 1996, c. 77, are  set out in  Davies v. Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce  (1987),  15 B.C.L.R. (2d) 256  at 259–260 (C.A.) : 1.     Was there a  bona fide  intention to appeal? 2.     When were the respondents informed of the intention? 3.     Would the respondents be unduly prejudiced by an extension of time? 4.     Is there merit in the appeal? 5.   Is it in  the interest of justice that an extension be granted? [4]     The merits threshold asks whether the appeal is “doomed to fail,” or,  alternatively, whether “it can be said with confidence that the appeal has no  merit”:  Stewart v. Postnikoff , 2014 BCCA 292  at  paras. 5– 6  (Chambers) . [5]     The final factor “encompasses the other four questions and states the  decisive question”:  Davies  at 260. As a  result, the merit of an appeal is also considered at that stage. In  A  Solicitor v. The Law Society of British Columbia , 2018 BCCA 163 at para. 37,  Bennett J.A. held that it “is not in the interests of justice to permit a meritless  appeal to go forward.” [6]     It is only the fourth and fifth criteria that are of concern in this  application. [7]     The underlying appeal is from an order in two personal injury actions.  The trial judge pronounced a mistrial. As a result of the mistrial, the jury  was discharged, and the judge ordered a new trial. The question that arises on  these facts is whether there is any utility to the appeals. [8]     The appellant contends that in the trial the judge ruled that certain  evidence concerning the plaintiff’s history of childhood abuse was irrelevant,  prejudicial, and therefore inadmissible. The appellant says the point of the  appeal is to argue that the judge erred in his ruling and, importantly, that  the ruling should not bind or carry forward to the new trial. [9]     Apart from the appellant’s concern about the implications of the  evidentiary ruling on the new trial, the appellant concedes there is no point  to the appeal. [10]     The other criteria in  Davies , as to the appellant’s intention to  appeal, notice to the respondents, and lack of prejudice to the respondents,  are all satisfied. As I said, the extension is only for four days. Counsel for  the applicant concedes that on appeal his only claim for relief is a new trial,  and that Justice Mayer has already ordered a new trial. But he says underlying  that order for a new trial is an erroneous evidentiary ruling. He is concerned  that the judge hearing the new trial will be bound by the evidentiary rulings  made at the trial that ended in a mistrial. The respondents say there is no  utility to this appeal and the extension ought not to be granted. Because an appeal  is from an order and not reasons, I conclude, and agree with the respondents, there  is no utility and, hence no merit, to the appeal.  [11]     The appeal is also ill‑conceived because the underlying  evidentiary rulings do not bind the new trial judge. [12]     In  Coulter v. Ball , 2007 BCSC 720,   Goepel J. (as he then was)  explained the law as it pertains to a new trial following a  successful  appeal : [ 19 ] Where a new trial is ordered, the  judge presiding at the new trial is not bound by findings made at the first  trial. A new trial is wholly independent of the first:  Bobolas &  another v. Economist Newspaper Ltd. , [1987] 3 All E.R. 121 (C.A.). [ 20 ] At a  new trial, all questions of fact in regards to the issues retried are at large  and are to be considered afresh:  Lewis v. Cook and Akenhead ,  [1950] 4 D.L.R. 136 (B.C.C.A.). The issues are considered  tabula rasa . The  parties may raise any issue pled regardless of the position taken at the first  trial:  Confederation Life Insurance Co. v. Woo  (1994), 123 Sask.  R. 150 (C.A.). [13]      Lewis v. Cook and Akenhead , [1950] 4 D.L.R. 136 (B.C.C.A.), mentioned  by Goepel J. in  Coulter  and followed in  Confederation Life Insurance  Co. v. Woo  (1994), 48 A.C.W.S. (3d) 1019 (Sask. C.A.), provides the  following guidance on the effect of a new trial:  [11] We are all of the opinion that the only order we  can make is that there should be a new trial. We are of the opinion that the learned  Judge who may take the second trial is, and should be, absolutely untrammelled  by any decision of the learned Judge who took the first trial, and on that I  wish to refer to two cases. The first case is  Roe v. Naylor  (1918), 87  L.J.K.B. 958, 119 LT 259. The Master of the Rolls said at p. 963:  Counsel for the appellants sought to rely upon some finding  of the Judge in the first trial of the action. In my opinion, he is not  entitled to do that. This action was sent for a new trial, and the second trial  superseded the first, and any finding in the first action was got rid of when  the action was sent for a new trial. [12] Now that refers apparently to a finding of fact.  The next case I am about to state refers to a question of law —  Venn v.  Tedesco , [1926] 2 K.B. 227, 95 L.J.K.B. 866. McCardie J. said at p. 237:   Such is the view I must take of the main point of law argued  before me, but I ought, ere concluding this judgment, to refer briefly to  another point raised on the plaintiff's behalf—namely, that, inasmuch as the  defendants' counsel, at the first trial of this action before the Lord Chief  Justice and a special jury, stated that he did not seek to rely on the  Public  Authorities Protection Act, 1893 , he was therefore precluded from raising  the point before me on the second trial of the action. I am unable to agree  with that contention. The point was one of law only. It involved no evidence,  and the facts on the point were not only admitted, but were actually pleaded in  the statement of claim itself. There is, I think, no estoppel in the matter.  The trial before me was a  de novo  hearing, and the defendants were  entitled to raise before me the point pleaded in their statement of defence. My  recollection is that this question has been decided by the Court of Appeal as I  now decide it, though I am unable to find a reported decision on the matter.  The cases quoted in the  Annual Practice , 1926 ed., p. 1154, tend, I  think, to support the view I now express. [14]     I agree with Goepel J. in  Coulter  and can see no reason why these  same principles would not apply equally in respect of an evidentiary ruling at a  new trial following a mistrial (as opposed to an appeal).  [15]     Similarly, although not binding, in a criminal context guidance may be  found in  R. v. Hilson , [1958] O.R. 665 (C.A.). The court allowed an  appeal from a murder conviction on the basis of errors in the jury charge and  remitted the matter for a new trial. In so doing, it noted that it found no  error in the trial judge’s decision to admit a confession. Nevertheless, it  cautioned that this ruling was not binding on the retrial: at paras. 3–4. [16]     That principle was endorsed in  R. v. Duhamel , 1981 ABCA 295 at para. 23,  aff’d, [1984] 2 S.C.R. 555. In  R. c. Cliche , 2010 QCCA 408,  Beauregard J.A. considered whether  Hilson  and  Duhamel  applied in  respect of a retrial following a mistrial, as opposed to an appeal. He found no  principled reason for distinguishing between the two situations, at paras. 13–17. [17]     Edwards J. also appears to have reached the same conclusion in  H.M.T.Q.  v. Dempsey , 2001 BCSC 371 at para. 7, where he applied  Hilson  in  relation to a retrial following a mistrial. [18]     Parenthetically, I recognize that in relation to criminal matters,   Cliche  and  Dempsey  have been overtaken by legislative developments.  In 2011, the  Criminal Code , R.S.C. 1985, c. C‑46   was  amended to include s. 653.1: Mistrial — rulings binding at new trial 653.1  In  the case of a mistrial, unless the court is satisfied that it would not be in  the interests of justice, rulings relating to the disclosure or admissibility  of evidence or the  Canadian  Charter of Rights and Freedoms  that were made during the trial  are binding on the parties in any new trial if the rulings are made — or could  have been made — before the stage at which the evidence on the merits is  presented. [19]     Parties to a retrial are entitled to reframe their case. They may choose  to adduce different evidence and advance different legal arguments, subject  only to the limitations imposed by their pleadings and the doctrine of abuse of  process. In those circumstances, the analysis of relevance, materiality, and  probative value of a given piece of evidence may be fundamentally different  than in the previous trial. The reasoning in the criminal authorities to which  I have referred, while not directly applicable, is persuasive. [20]     It follows that I would, in these circumstances, dismiss the applications  for the extension of time on the grounds that there is no merit or utility in  the appeals and, consequently, it is not in the interests of justice that  either of these applications for extensions of time be granted. [21]     The applications in both appeals to extend time to serve notices of  appeal are dismissed. Both appeals stand dismissed. “The Honourable Madam Justice Garson”"},"meta":{},"created_at":"2022-03-08T08:08:14.440332Z","updated_at":"2022-03-08T08:08:14.440346Z","project":2},{"id":43,"annotations":[{"id":49,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"start":3,"end":40,"text":"THE SUPREME COURT OF BRITISH COLUMBIA","labels":["COURT_NAME"]},"id":"3e221c42-9","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":148,"end":164,"text":"Samantha Knowles","labels":["PERS_APPELLANT"]},"id":"3e221c7e-9","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":179,"end":207,"text":"Christopher  Alexander Brown","labels":["PERS_RESPONDENT"]},"id":"3e221ca6-9","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":209,"end":227,"text":"Shane Lloyd Brown ","labels":["PERS_RESPONDENT"]},"id":"3e221cd8-9","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":241,"end":281,"text":"Dueck  Chevrolet Buick Cadillac GMC Ltd.","labels":["PERS_RESPONDENT"]},"id":"3e221d0a-9","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":311,"end":340,"text":"The Honourable Justice Blake ","labels":["PERS_JUDGE"]},"id":"3e221d3c-9","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":441,"end":454,"text":"G.J.

Brown,   2022 BCSC 154 Date: 20220112 Docket: M-1810511 Registry:  Vancouver Between: Samantha Knowles Plaintiff And Christopher  Alexander Brown, Shane Lloyd Brown (Lessee)  and Dueck  Chevrolet Buick Cadillac GMC Ltd. (Lessor) Defendants Before:  The Honourable Justice Blake Oral Reasons for Judgment     In Chambers Counsel for the Plaintiff     appearing by teleconference: G.J. Collette Counsel for the Defendants     appearing by teleconference: D. Lavoie Place and Date of Trial\/Hearing: Vancouver, B.C. January 12, 2022 Place and Date of Judgment: Vancouver, B.C. January 12, 2022   [1]     THE COURT:  The plaintiff applies pursuant to s. 10 of the  Law  and Equity Act , R.S.B.C. 1996, c. 253, or alternatively pursuant to  either Rule 9-6 or 9-7 of the  Supreme Court Civil Rules , B.C.  Reg. 168\/2009, for an order for judgment in the terms of the defendants'  offer to settle dated October 6, 2021, which was accepted by the plaintiff on  October 8, 2021. She also seeks an order that the defendants pay to the  plaintiff the costs of the action to October 6, 2021, assessed in accordance  with Rule 14-1 of the  Supreme Court Civil Rules .  [2]     Both of these orders are necessary to authorize the Registrar to assess  the plaintiff's bill of costs, and neither are objected to by the defendants.  [3]     However, the plaintiff also seeks an order that the costs of the action  be assessed by the Registrar without application of s. 5 of the  Disbursements  and Expert Evidence Regulation , B.C. Reg. 210\/2020, which the defendants  object to. [4]     There is no dispute by the parties on the relevant underlying facts. By  way of brief background, the underlying action arises from injuries the  plaintiff sustained in a motor vehicle accident on October 6, 2017. The notice  of trial in this action was filed on July 7, 2020, and the trial was scheduled  to be heard on October 12, 2021, for 19 days. On October 6, 2021, the defendants  served an offer to settle on the plaintiff pursuant to Rule 9-1 of the  Supreme  Court Civil Rules,  which the plaintiff accepted unconditionally by letter  dated October 8, 2021 (the “Settlement”).  [5]     The material terms of the Settlement are as follows: The plaintiff will be entitled to payment by the defendants  of $520,000 (the “Settlement Payment). The parties will be entitled to  costs in accordance with this offer to settle (the “Settlement Costs”). The plaintiff has executed the necessary release and has  received the Settlement Payment.  [6]     The Settlement contained the following term with respect to the Settlement  Costs:  The plaintiff is entitled to her  costs of this action at Scale B, and necessary and reasonable disbursements to  the date of the delivery of this offer assessed in accordance with Rule 14-1 of  the  Supreme Court Civil Rules. There was no express mention of the  Disbursements  and Expert Evidence  Regulation ; however, the appropriate  interpretation of the phrase \"assessed in accordance with Rule 14-1 of the   Supreme Court Civil Rules\"  is the issue before me.  [7]     The parties disagree on the application of the  Disbursements and  Expert Evidence Regulation  to the bill of costs of the plaintiff: a)   the plaintiff  takes the position that because it was not specifically referenced in the offer  to settle it should have no effect on the assessment of her bill of costs. They  argue that as the offer said “costs assessed in accordance with Rule 14-1”, only  Rule 14-1 should apply, and the  Disbursements and Expert Evidence Regulation   should not have any application;  b)   the defendants  say that as the  Disbursements and Expert Evidence Regulation  has been in  force in British Columbia since February 12, 2021, any assessment of a bill of  costs pursuant to Rule 14-1 of the  Supreme Court Civil Rules  after that  date would be subject to that legislation. They take the position that there  was no need for that law to be specifically referenced in the offer to settle,  as it was the law in force at the time that would have to be applied by the Registrar  in assessing the plaintiff's bill of costs. [8]     The issue before me is whether a Registrar assessing a bill of costs in  a vehicle injury action pursuant to Rule 14-1 of the  Supreme Court Civil  Rules , after the  Disbursements and Expert Evidence Regulation  came  into force, is required to apply the provisions of the  Disbursements and  Expert Evidence Regulation  in their assessment of the plaintiff's costs and  disbursements. [9]     By way of background, the  Disbursements and Expert Evidence  Regulation  came into force on February 12, 2021, and s. 5 applies to  the assessment of disbursements in a vehicle injury proceeding (whether damages  are assessed by the court or an offer to settle the proceeding is accepted).  [10]     The plaintiff referred me to the decision of  Walsh v. Walsh , 2018  BCSC 199, in which Justice Riley rendered judgment in an application to enforce  an agreement, and specifically one specific term in the agreement. In the  Walsh   decision, Justice Riley set out a procedure for resolving settlement agreement  disputes, and in particular when the court is asked to interpret and give  effect to the agreement. I agree with Justice Riley that I have the authority  to give effect to an agreement pursuant to s. 10 of the  Law and Equity  Act  (see para. 22).  [11]     The issue before me is an interpretation one. The Settlement makes clear  the parties agreed that “The plaintiff is entitled to her costs of this action  at Scale B, and necessary and reasonable disbursements to the date of delivery  of this offer,  assessed in accordance with Rule 14-1 of the  Supreme Court  Civil Rules . ” (emphasis added). Absent any other agreed terms in  a settlement, such an assessment of costs and disbursements must be in  accordance not only with the  Supreme Court Civil Rules,  but all other  applicable legislation and case law relevant to the determination of the  assessed costs. In this case, that would include s. 5 of the  Disbursements  and Expert Evidence Regulation .  [12]     I note that the timing of the filing of the notice of trial, the trial  date that was set and the date the disbursements were incurred will all be  issues for the Registrar to consider in their assessment of the bill of costs  pursuant to s. 5(3)(b) of the  Disbursements and Expert Evidence  Regulation .  [13]     Accordingly, I order the following.  a)   judgment in the  terms of the defendants' offer to settle dated October 6, 2021, accepted by the  plaintiff on October 8, 2021, both of which letters are to be attached as  Appendix A to this Order;  b)   the defendants  pay to the plaintiff the costs of the action to October 6, 2021, assessed in  accordance with Rule 14-1 of the  Supreme Court Civil Rules ; and c)   the costs and  disbursements of the plaintiff be assessed by the Registrar with application of  s. 5 of the  Disbursements and Expert Evidence Regulation . [14]     With respect to the costs of this application, although the plaintiff  has not been successful in this application, this was a matter which had to be  clarified for both parties before the assessment of the bill of costs could  properly occur, and accordingly I make no order as to costs. [15]     Is there anything arising counsel? [16]     COUNSEL: No, thank you, Justice. [17]     COUNSEL: Thank you. [18]     THE COURT: Thank you very much. [19]     I gave these reasons orally at the conclusion of the submissions. I have  edited them without change to the substance or result.  “Blake  J.”"},"meta":{},"created_at":"2022-03-08T08:08:14.439970Z","updated_at":"2022-03-08T08:08:14.439983Z","project":2},{"id":41,"annotations":[{"id":47,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"start":0,"end":36,"text":"COURT OF APPEAL FOR BRITISH COLUMBIA","labels":["COURT_NAME"]},"id":"3e222a02-9","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":125,"end":140,"text":"Masood Masjoody","labels":["PERS_APPELLANT"]},"id":"3e222a3e-9","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":167,"end":184,"text":"Am élie Trotignon","labels":["PERS_RESPONDENT"]},"id":"3e222a70-9","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":189,"end":213,"text":"Simon Fraser  University","labels":["PERS_RESPONDENT"]},"id":"3e222ac0-9","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":375,"end":412,"text":"the Supreme Court of British Columbia","labels":["PERS_RESPONDENT"]},"id":"3e222af2-9","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":593,"end":608,"text":"Dr. M.

Outerbridge Settlement of the  Contents of the Respondents’ Appeal Books Reasons for decision  from: An order of the Supreme Court of British Columbia,   dated August 3, 2021 ( Masjoody v. Trotignon , 2021 BCSC 1502,   Vancouver Docket S204587).  Oral Reasons for Decision The Appellant, appearing in person (via videoconference): Dr. M. Masjoody Counsel for the Respondents (via videoconference): Y. Li-Reilly Place and Date of Hearing: Vancouver, British   Columbia February 1, 2022 Place and Date of Decision: Vancouver, British   Columbia February 1, 2022   Summary: Settlement of the respondents’ appeal books by the  Registrar in an appeal challenging an order dismissing the appellant’s claim  for want of jurisdiction. The appellant sought the removal of a pleading,  various affidavits, and other documents from the respondents’ appeal books. Held:  The appellant’s application is dismissed. The challenged material was properly  within the respondents’ appeal books. REGISTRAR  OUTERBRIDGE :  [1]     The appellant, Dr. Masjoody,  applies to settle the contents of the respondents’ appeal books. He seeks the  removal of a pleading, certain affidavits, and other documents on the basis  they were not before the chambers judge or are not necessary to resolve the  issues on the appeal. [2]     Dr. Masjoody  was a doctoral student and instructor with Simon Fraser University (SFU) in the  Department of Mathematics. He was dismissed in 2020. [3]     During his  employment, he alleges that he suffered bullying, discrimination, harassment,  defamation, and “conspiracy to defamation.” These claims gave rise to his  notice of civil claim filed in April 2020. Many of these claims relate to the  conduct of a colleague, Ms. Trotignon, but also involve other SFU  employees as described within his notice. Paragraph 7 of the amended notice of  civil claim states: As  of late August 2019, defendants together engaged in defamation and conspiracy  campaigns against me, based on fabricated and false claims initially made by  Trotignon against me concerning her personal relationship with me and other  claims regarding Trotignon’s personal relationship with me that were fabricated  by Mishna and Kropinski and distributed by, and on behalf of, the defendants. [4]     Dr. Masjoody alleges  that these “campaigns” were in retaliation to a report he sent to SFU’s  administration which he says details the engagement of the university with  certain persons affiliated with the Islamic Republic of Iran. [5]     On the basis that  these and other claims advanced should be adjudicated by the Labour Relations  Board under the terms of Dr. Masjoody’s collective agreement, the  respondents successfully struck out his amended notice of civil claim for want  of jurisdiction on 3 August 2021. On 17 August 2021, Dr. Masjoody appealed  that order to this Court.  [6]     In attacking the  chambers judge’s order, Dr. Masjoody argues the judge narrowed the dispute  between the parties to one that centered on his employment relationship, which  he characterizes very differently. In a broadly drawn factum, he argues the  chambers judge should have considered a narrower or different set of facts,  misconstrued facts, and otherwise made errors in her analysis which led to the  striking of his claim. He also alleges several procedural irregularities.  [7]     With respect to the  respondents’ appeal books, he argues material has been included within that is  unnecessary and: (1) relevant to another application seeking to enjoin him from  publishing certain material (an application that was resolved by consent); or (2)  relevant to an “abuse of process” argument that was, in the end, not considered  by the judge.  [8]     The records at issue  are: a)     The notice of civil  claim, filed on 30 April 2020 (not the version amended on 25 June 2021);  b)     Dr. Masjoody’s  affidavit #3, which appends and describes communications with several SFU  staff, including the former Chair of the SFU mathematics department; c)     Three exhibits to an  affidavit of the respondents’ counsel’s legal assistant, containing: i.     Dr. Masjoody’s  response to a Human Rights complaint launched by a faculty member;  ii.     An email sent by Dr. Masjoody  to the SFU mathematics department, describing a dispute concerning the  assignment of grades for one of his courses;  iii.     Social media and  other publications between 26 October 2020 and 20 January 2021; d)     Four legal  assistants’ affidavits attaching various social media posts and other  publications; and e)     An unfiled document,  entitled “Timeline of Plaintiff’s (Masood Masjoody) Social Media and Email  Publications January 14, 2020, to April 5, 2021.” [9]     The legal test for  the inclusion of records in an appeal book was restated in  Iser v. Attorney  General of Canada,  2017 BCCA 358 (Registrar): [2] An  appeal book is prepared in accordance with Rule 26 and Form 12. The completion  instructions for Form 12 provide that the parties must include within their  appeal book “only so much of the evidence, including exhibits, affidavits and  other documents, as is necessary to resolve the issues raised on appeal.” The  language of Form 12 encourages counsel to reduce the size of the appeal book by  ensuring: a)  Records within the appeal books are “evidence” before the chambers judge. As I  discuss further below, this means records listed in the notice of application  or application response, included in the application record, or otherwise  placed before the chambers judge; and, b) Records  within the appeal books are necessary to resolve the issues raised on appeal.  In other words, the records are connected to the issues advanced or responded  to within the appeal, usually within the parties’ factums. [10]     Justice Finch (as he  then was) also described the discretion to be exercised by the Registrar in  settling appeal books in  Re Fuller  (1995), 59 B.C.A.C. 303. In that  case, although under an earlier set of rules, he emphasized the importance of  establishing both the relevance of the documents to the subject matter of the  appeal and their necessity of their inclusion. The current Form 12 uses only  the term “necessary” but presumably, irrelevant records will also be  unnecessary. [11]     I turn now to  considering the impugned documents:  a)     The Notice of  Civil Claim:  One of Dr. Masjoody’s  arguments on the appeal is that the chambers judge wrongly referred to his  notice of civil claim rather than the amended version. Both are referred to in  the chambers judge’s reasons and the parties’ factums. To understand whether Dr. Masjoody’s  argument has merit and any prejudice arose, the Court will also need to see  both. I do not agree with Dr. Masjoody’s position that an appeal book  cannot, within limits, contain documents other than affidavits or exhibits:  Achtymichuk  v. Bayer Inc. , 2021 BCCA 393 at para. 9 (Registrar). I find the  original notice of civil claim is necessary and properly included in the  respondents’ appeal book. b)     Affidavit #3 of Dr. Masjoody:  This affidavit contains narrative and  exhibits relevant to Dr. Masjoody’s various communications with SFU staff.  In particular, it contains details relating to exchanges between Dr. Masjoody  and Dr. Kropinski, the then Chair of the SFU mathematics department. The  relationship between Dr. Masjoody and Dr. Kropinski and other staff  members are detailed within Dr. Masjoody’s amended notice of civil claim,  his factum, and are described by the chambers judge in her reasons,  particularly at para. 75. This affidavit, along with others elsewhere in  the record, contain facts relevant to how the judge characterized the conduct  of Dr. Masjoody and others forming part of his claim. For these reasons,  this affidavit is also necessary and properly included in the respondents’  appeal book. c)     Affidavits and  Exhibits Relating to Social Media Posts:  In her reasons, the chambers judge described several of Dr. Masjoody’s  social media posts. She relied upon them to provide “… further  details of the nature and subject matter of his dispute with the defendants”: at  para. 58. Again, these posts provide needed context to understand the  conduct of Dr. Masjoody and others, facts that are central to the judge’s  conclusions about the essential character of Dr. Masjoody’s claim. As the  judge stated at para. 76: “All of these affidavits,  along with the  Internet postings , concern Dr. Masjoody’s persistent and escalating  allegations of harassment and improper conduct of SFU employees toward him in  relation to his employment at SFU and his reputation within the SFU community”  (my emphasis). As I explained, Dr. Masjoody is free to argue those conclusions  are in error, but the Court should have these exhibits in the record to provide  context to ground those arguments. These affidavits are also necessary and  properly included in the respondents’ appeal book. d)     Social Media  Posts Timeline:  This  document was prepared as a litigation aid to help the chambers judge understand  the timing of Dr. Masjoody’s social media posts. The respondents point to  a section of Dr. Masjoody’s factum, where he alleges that the chambers  judge relied excessively on the respondents’ version of the facts and questions  whether the judge read the material before her: at para. 57. They say this  document is required to establish the context of the submissions that they  made, showing where they directed the judge’s attention. Written submissions are  normally excluded from an appeal book, and the question here is whether there  is a “good reason” to include them:  Van Mol (Guardian ad litem of) v.  Ashmore  (1997), 86 B.C.A.C. 60 aff’d 88 B.C.A.C. 262 at para. 3;  Achtymichuk .  In my view, there is. Though the documents do not contain “argument”  per se ,  Dr. Masjoody’s challenge to the judge’s reasoning process is so broadly  cast that the Court should see this document for the reason the respondents  suggest. This document is also necessary and properly included in the  respondents’ appeal book. [12]     I would dismiss the  relief sought under Dr. Masjoody’s appointment.  [13]     As the respondents  have been successful, they are entitled to their ordinary costs. “T.R.

Lloyd,   2019 BCCA 25 Date: 20190115 Docket: CA45046 Between: Regina Respondent And Joseph Ryan Lloyd Appellant Before: The Honourable Mr. Justice Harris The Honourable Madam Justice Stromberg-Stein The Honourable Madam Justice Fenlon On appeal from: An  order of the Provincial Court of British Columbia, dated September 18, 2017  (conviction) and January 5, 2018 (sentence) ( R. v. Lloyd , Vancouver  Registry 233735-2-C). Oral Reasons for Judgment Counsel for the Appellant: D.N. Fai Counsel for the Respondent: J.N. Walker Place and Date of Hearing: Vancouver, British   Columbia January 15, 2019 Place and Date of Judgment: Vancouver, British   Columbia January 15, 2019   Summary: Appeal of convictions on basis  that an arrest search incidental to arrest that produced evidence on which some  of the convictions depended was unlawful and the search unreasonable. Appeal  dismissed; the judge did not misapprehend the evidence critical to her  conclusion that the arrest was lawful, the search was reasonable, and the  evidence was admissible.  [1]     HARRIS J.A. : Mr. Lloyd appeals his conviction of multiple  counts of possession of controlled substances for the purposes of trafficking,  carrying a concealed weapon (a knife), possession of a weapon for a purpose  dangerous to the public peace, obstructing a peace officer, and assaulting a  peace officer with a weapon. [2]     Critical to his convictions was the result of a voir dire held to  determine the admissibility of evidence seized in a search incidental to his  arrest. Mr. Lloyd contended that his arrest was unlawful and accordingly  the search was unreasonable. [3]     It is not necessary to recount the facts in detail. In short, Mr. Lloyd  was approached by two plain clothes police officers as he sat with another man  outside a coffee shop. The judge accepted that the officers advised the men  that they were police officers investigating a bylaw infraction for smoking  within six metres of a doorway. They advised them that they were not free to leave.  They asked for their names and dates of birth. The accused was uncooperative  but eventually gave his name. One of the officers queried both names on the  computer in the police car. Before the process was complete, the other officer  noticed a bulge in the accused’s clothing that he suspected to be a weapon. He  called a warning to the police officer in the vehicle, who returned to the  scene.  [4]     The officers were concerned that the accused was about to run. They  advised him again that he was not free to go and warned him of the offence of  obstructing police. One officer attempted to grab his arm. A fight ensued and  the accused attempted to draw a knife. The police knocked it out of his hand  and a bystander retrieved it. The fight was intense. The accused was arrested  and searched while handcuffed, lying on the ground, and still struggling. He  was found to be carrying a leather purse under his shirt which contained 25.7  grams of cocaine, 56.59 grams of methamphetamine, and 51.29 grams of heroin and  fentanyl in combination. The drugs were in small plastic bags. The accused was  also carrying a digital scale, two knives, and $1,780 in cash. [5]     The defence argued that the evidence should be excluded because the  whole police interaction was a ruse for the purposes of interacting with the  accused. Alternatively, the defence argued that the arrest for obstruction was  unlawful, because the officers had already completed the identification of the  accused: they had learned his name and one of them recognized the name. Therefore  there was no further reason to detain him, the arrest was unlawful, and the  ensuing search violated s. 8 of the  Charter . The defence also  argued that the police tried to conceal, in their initial report to Crown  counsel, the original purpose for their surveillance, and that this should cast  doubt on all their evidence. [6]     The judge concluded that the arrest was lawful, the search was  reasonable, and the evidence was admissible. She found that the police did not  try to conceal the initial purpose of their investigation. She found the facts  as I have set them out above. In so doing, she rejected the position on the  facts taken by Mr. Lloyd’s counsel. She accepted that the police had not  completed their confirmation of Mr. Lloyd’s identity. The officers were  still engaged in the execution of their duty to identify the accused at the  time of the obstructive conduct. She concluded that the arrest was lawful. The  search conducted incidental to that arrest did not violate s. 8 of the  Charter .  There was justification for a safety search, as the officers had reason to  believe the accused was carrying a weapon and was backing away while blading  his body away from the officer.  [7]     The evidence from the voir dire was admitted as evidence at trial. The  findings of fact made in the voir dire reasons formed the foundation of the  reasons for conviction. Mr. Lloyd contends that the judge made multiple  errors in the conclusions she reached, but, in my view, they boil down to the  proposition that the judge misapprehended the evidence in ways that  contaminated her critical finding that the arrest was lawful. [8]     As is well known, this Court shows deference to the findings of fact  made by a trial judge in the absence of demonstrable error. In this particular  case, I do not think the appeal can succeed unless Mr. Lloyd can  demonstrate that the judge committed palpable and overriding errors of fact  through misapprehending critical evidence. If the facts, as found by the trial  judge are accepted, there is, in my view, not other basis to interfere with the  convictions. [9]     I do not think that Mr. Lloyd has done more than reargue his case  at trial. He has not demonstrated any reversible error in the judge’s findings  or reasoning. What he has done is attempt to persuade us that the judge ought  to have reached different conclusions, for example, by taking a different view  of the credibility of the officers or in her assessment of whether subjective and  objective grounds existed for the arrest. I am satisfied that the judge did not  misapprehend the evidence in the manner required to justify appellate  intervention. All of the material findings of fact made by the judge were open  to her on, and well-supported by, the evidence.

Shao,   2019 BCCA 52 Date: 20190204 Docket: CA45217 Between: Mei Zhen Wang Appellant (Plaintiff) And Feng Yun Shao also  known Shao Feng Yun also known as Amy  Barsha Washington Respondent (Defendant) Before: The Honourable Mr. Justice Hunter (In Chambers) On appeal from: An  order of the Supreme Court of British Columbia, dated   March 9, 2018 ( Wang v. Shao , 2018 BCSC 377, Vancouver Docket S101156). Oral Reasons for Judgment Counsel for the Appellant: R.V. Wickett, Q.C. E. Dvorak, Articled   Student Counsel for the Respondent: M. Azevedo Place and Date of Hearing: Vancouver, British   Columbia February 4, 2019 Place and Date of Judgment: Vancouver, British   Columbia February 4, 2019   Summary: The respondent applies for  security for costs of the trial and the appeal. The notice of appeal was filed  on April 6, 2018. Appeal books and factums have been filed. The appeal is set  for hearing March 7, 2019. Held: Application dismissed. In light of the delay  in bringing this application and the proximity of the scheduled date for  hearing the appeal, the interests of justice do not support an order for  security for costs. [1]     HUNTER J.A. : The respondent applies for security for costs of the  appeal and the trial. [2]     The nature of the underlying litigation was described by the trial judge  in the opening paragraph of his judgment (indexed at 2018 BCSC 377): [1] This case concerns the  collapsed sale of a Shaughnessy luxury home. The question at the core of this  dispute is whether the failure of the vendor to disclose the unsolved murder of  an occupant of the property, which occurred almost 2 years before the sale,  entitled the buyer to refuse to complete the purchase, and to recover her  deposit. [3]     The trial judge concluded that it did. He held that the respondent had  been induced to enter into the contract for the purchase of the property by a  fraudulent misrepresentation by the appellant, and was entitled to rescind the  contract and recover her deposit.  [4]     The trial judgment was pronounced on March 9, 2018. The appellant filed  a notice of appeal on April 6, 2018. The transcript and appeal record were  filed on June 29, 2018. The appellant filed her appeal book and factum on  August 13, 2018, and the respondent filed her factum on September 26, 2018. A  certificate of readiness was filed on November 28, 2018 and the appeal is now  scheduled to be heard on March 7, 2019, 31 days from today. [5]     The basis for the application is that the appellant resides in China and  does not appear to have any assets in British Columbia that would be exigible  to pay costs if the appeal is unsuccessful. [6]     The practice of this Court when security for costs is ordered is well  settled. The appellant will be given some time to post the costs, normally 30  days. The appeal is stayed until costs are posted. If costs are not posted by  the specified date, a justice may dismiss the appeal as abandoned, pursuant to  s. 24(2) of the  Court of Appeal Act , R.S.B.C. 1996, c. 77.  [7]     The considerations that are relevant to the decision to order security  for costs to be posted are also well settled. This Court summarized them in  Ellis  v. Denman Island Local Trust Committee , 2016 BCCA 135, in these terms: [7] In  Creative Salmon Company Ltd. v. Staniford ,  2007 BCCA 285 (in Chambers), Lowry J.A. provided a concise statement of the  relevant criteria on an application for security for costs of the appeal: [9] The jurisdiction to  order security for costs of an appeal is found in s. 24 of the  Court of  Appeal Act , R.S.B.C. 1996, c. 77. The appellant against which such an  order is sought bears the onus of showing why security should not be required:    Kedia v. Shandro Dixon Edgson , 2007 BCCA 57 at para. 4 (C.A.  Chambers), Smith J.A. Generally, the considerations are the appellant's ability  to post security and the likelihood of costs awarded being recovered from it,  as well as the merits and the timeliness of the application : Southeast  Toyota Distributors, Inc. v. Branch  (1997), 45 B.C.L.R. (3d) 163 (C.A.);  Milina  v. Bartsch  (1985), 5 C.P.C. (2d) 124 at 125 (B.C.C.A. Chambers), Seaton  J.A.; and  M.(M.) v. F.(R.)  (1997), 43 B.C.L.R. (3d) 98 at 101 (C.A.  Chambers), Esson J.A. [8] In  Lu v. Mao , 2006 BCCA 560 (in Chambers),  Ryan J.A. explained: [6] In determining whether  security for costs should be ordered, the ultimate question to be answered is  whether the order would be in the interests of justice. In this regard, Madam  Justice Rowles in  Ferguson v. Ferstay  (2000), 81 B.C.L.R. (3d) 90 at para. 7;  2000 BCCA 592, (in Chambers) identified the following as relevant  considerations:  (1) appellant’s financial means;  (2) the merits of the appeal;  (3) the timeliness of the  application; and  (4) whether the costs will be readily  recoverable. [8]     In opposing the order for security for costs, the appellant focuses on  the timeliness consideration. The notice of motion seeking this relief was  filed and served on January 16, 2019, well after the appeal documents and a  certificate of readiness were filed. The appeal is set to proceed on March 7,  2019, 31 days from today. The evidence is that the appellant is aged 84, does  not speak English and resides in China. The process of communicating with the  appellant requires translations by the appellant’s daughter or granddaughter.  The trial costs have not been assessed, and I am told that no demand for  payment of trial costs was made before service of this application on January  16. [9]     I have no evidence as to the ability of the appellant to pay security  for costs, but the parties agree that it is likely that she has sufficient  resources. The issue is whether she can be compelled to do so if she is  unsuccessful in this appeal. [10]     In some cases, the fact that nearly all the costs required to prepare  the case for appeal, including costs of preparing the appeal books, transcripts  and factum, have been expended before the security for costs application is  brought, is of itself sufficient reason to dismiss the application: see e.g.,  Grewal  v. Khakh , 2018 BCCA 3 (Chambers) at para. 13;  Hayes v. Schimpf ,  2005 BCCA 413 (Chambers) at para. 11. In other cases, security may be  ordered on a late application when no unfairness would result to the appellant  as a result of the lack of timeliness: e.g.,  Ducharme v. Rempel , 2015  BCCA 437 (Chambers). But bringing the application so close to the scheduled  appeal date creates specific timeliness problems that mitigate against granting  an order that might otherwise have been given. [11]     Justice Esson addressed this problem in  M.(M.) v. F.(R.) , [1998]  9 W.W.R. 309 (B.C.C.A.) (in Chambers). In addressing the significance of the  upcoming appeal date, Esson J.A. (as then was) made these comments: [6] As I see it, the overriding difficulty with  respect to making any order is that the application comes so late. Had an  application for security been made at an earlier stage of the appeal  proceedings before the heavy costs of transcripts, appeal books and factum  preparation were incurred, it might well have been right to make an order for  security of costs, at least in respect of the costs in this Court and perhaps  also in the court below. … [7] An order for security for costs is ordinarily made  effective by providing that the appeal be stayed until security is posted. When  such an order is made in the earliest stages of the appeal, that can generally  be done without injustice to the appellant. But that is not possible on the eve  of the hearing, and so that ordinary form of sanction is out of the question. … [8] I conclude that at  this late stage of the proceeding, there is no feasible method to give Mrs. F.  the protection she seeks without injustice to the appellant. The application is  dismissed. [12]     The application described by Esson J.A. as being heard “on the eve of  the hearing” was heard six weeks before the scheduled appeal date. In our case,  the application has been brought a month before the appeal date. If the order  was made, the appeal stayed, and the usual 30 days were given to the appellant  to arrange for the posting of security, it might not be until the day before  the hearing that the parties and the Court knew whether the appeal was going  ahead. This is not a tenable proposition, particularly when no satisfactory  reason has been given for the delay by the respondent in bringing this  application. The respondent has suggested that I might reduce the time  available to post security, but it does not appear to me appropriate to  truncate the usual time period when the problem arises from an untimely  application. [13]     In these particular circumstances, I am not prepared to make an order  for security for costs. Had the application been brought earlier, the result  might well have been different, at least as relates to the appeal costs, but at  this stage of the proceedings I am not satisfied that an order can be made  without injustice to the appellant. [14]     Accordingly, the application for security for costs of the appeal and  the trial is dismissed. “The  Honourable Mr. Justice Hunter”"},"meta":{},"created_at":"2022-03-08T08:08:14.438248Z","updated_at":"2022-03-08T08:08:14.438263Z","project":2},{"id":28,"annotations":[{"id":34,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"start":3,"end":40,"text":"THE SUPREME COURT OF BRITISH COLUMBIA","labels":["COURT_NAME"]},"id":"3e22c9b2-9","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":178,"end":190,"text":"Sam Kwon Woo","labels":["PERS_APPELLANT"]},"id":"3e22c9e4-9","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":207,"end":214,"text":"Sam Woo","labels":["PERS_APPELLANT"]},"id":"3e22ca16-9","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":243,"end":253,"text":"Ok Yon Woo","labels":["PERS_APPELLANT"]},"id":"3e22ca3e-9","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":268,"end":311,"text":"Crème De La Crumb  Bakeshop & Catering Ltd.","labels":["PERS_RESPONDENT"]},"id":"3e22ca70-9","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":331,"end":366,"text":"The Honourable Mr. Justice Skolrood","labels":["PERS_JUDGE"]},"id":"3e22caa2-9","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":19758,"end":19770,"text":"Skolrood  J.","labels":["PERS_JUDGE"]},"id":"3e22caca-9","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":4672,"end":4690,"text":"Mr. Justice Ehrcke","labels":["PERS_JUDGE"]},"id":"3e22cafc-9","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":4987,"end":5002,"text":"Justice Ehrcke ","labels":["PERS_JUDGE"]},"id":"3e22cb2e-9","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":7387,"end":7401,"text":"Justice Ehrcke","labels":["PERS_JUDGE"]},"id":"3e22cb56-9","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":503,"end":512,"text":"M.

THE SUPREME COURT OF BRITISH COLUMBIA Citation: Woo v. Crème De La Crumb Bakeshop & Catering Ltd.,   2020 BCSC 42 Date: 20200114 Docket: S159510 Registry:  Vancouver Between: Sam Kwon Woo, also  known as Sam Woo, by his litigation Guardian Ok Yon Woo Plaintiff And Crème De La Crumb  Bakeshop & Catering Ltd. Defendant Before:  The Honourable Mr. Justice Skolrood Supplementary Reasons for Judgment (to   Woo v. Crème De La Crumb Bakeshop & Catering Ltd. , 2019 BCSC 1752) Counsel for the Plaintiff: M. Dorner    R.K. Buchanan Counsel for the Defendant: A. Eged    J. Skinnider, Articled Student Place and Date of Trial\/Hearing: Vancouver, B.C. December 2, 2019 Place and Date of Judgment: Vancouver, B.C. January 14, 2020   [1]     On October 15, 2019, I issued reasons for judgment in this matter, which  are indexed at 2019 BCSC 1752. The action arose out of an incident that  occurred on February 17, 2015, when the plaintiff fell from a ladder while  working at premises leased by the defendant, resulting in catastrophic  injuries. [2]     I awarded the plaintiff a total of $340,000 in damages, but then reduced  that amount by 50% to reflect an equal apportionment of liability between the  plaintiff and the defendant. [3]     In addition to the claim for damages, the plaintiff advanced a claim  under the  Health Care Costs Recovery Act , S.B.C. 2008, c. 27 [ HCCRA ],  and sought to introduce into evidence a Minister’s certificate issued under  that Act (the “Minister’s Certificate”). The defendant objected and it was  agreed that consideration of this issue would be deferred until after the  release of the above-mentioned reasons. [4]     On December 2, 2019, the parties appeared before me to deal with the  HCCRA   claim. [5]     The relevant provisions of the  HCCRA  include the following: Definitions 1   In  this Act: … \" future cost of health care services \"  means the present value of the estimated  total cost of all health care services that are provided, or are reasonably  expected to be provided, to a beneficiary as a direct or indirect result of a  personal injury described in section 2 after the date of settlement or, if  there is no settlement, after the first day of trial; … \" health care services claim \" , in relation to personal injury suffered by  a beneficiary, means a claim for the recovery of the past and future costs of  health care services attributable to that personal injury; \" past cost of health care services \"  means the total cost of all health care  services provided to a beneficiary as a direct or indirect result of a personal  injury described in section 2, including those services provided up to and including  the date of settlement or, if there is no settlement, the first day of trial; … Obligation to claim 3   (1)  If, in the beneficiary's own name or as a member of a class of persons under  the  Class Proceedings Act , a beneficiary referred to in section 2  (1)  [beneficiary's right to recover]  of this Act or the  beneficiary's personal or other legal representative commences a legal  proceeding against a person alleged to be the wrongdoer for damages arising  from or related to the beneficiary's personal injury or death, the beneficiary  or the beneficiary's personal or other legal representative must include a  health care services claim in that legal proceeding. … Minister's certificates 16   (1)  A certificate (a) purporting  to have been issued by or on behalf of the minister for the purposes of (i) a health  care services claim, or (ii) recovery  under section 13 (5)  [settlement of claims] , and (b) setting out  the health care services that have been received by a beneficiary or class of  beneficiaries and the health care services that a beneficiary or class of  beneficiaries will likely receive in the future for personal injuries suffered  as a result of the negligence or wrongful act or omission of a wrongdoer, is proof of those health care  services. (2) A certificate (a) purporting  to have been issued by or on behalf of the minister for the purposes of (i) a health  care services claim, or (ii) recovery  under section 13 (5)  [settlement of claims] , and (b) setting out  the past cost of health care services, the future cost of health care services,  or both, attributable to personal injury suffered by a beneficiary or a class  of beneficiaries, is conclusive proof of the past cost of health care  services, the future cost of health care services, or both, as the case may be. [6]     There has been minimal consideration of the  HCCRA  in the case law,  in particular s. 16. One notable exception is  MacEachern v. Rennie , 2009  BCSC 652, in which Mr. Justice Ehrcke examined the statute in some detail in  the context of an application by the plaintiff to amend the statement of claim  to add a claim under the  HCCRA . The application was brought shortly  after the statute was proclaimed in force on April 1, 2009, and after the trial  had commenced.  [7]     Justice Ehrcke denied the application to amend. In doing so, he  considered the meaning to be given to s. 16 of the statute: [24]   …  Counsel for the plaintiff submits that the Minister's certificate is  conclusive proof of the facts contained in it and is therefore not rebuttable. Consequently,  in the plaintiff's submission, it would be pointless for the defendants to lead  evidence or cross-examine the plaintiff's witnesses about the health care costs  since that evidence or cross-examination could not, in law, have any effect in  challenging the health care costs as set out in the Minister's certificate. [25]  I do not  agree with the plaintiff's interpretation of s. 16 of the [ HCCRA ]. That  section sets out two different kinds of certificate evidence. Under  s. 16(1) the Minister may file a certificate setting out the health care  services that have been received by the beneficiary, and in the words of the  section, that certificate \"is proof of those health care services.\" [26]  Section  16(2) is worded differently. Under s. 16(2), the Minister may file a  certificate setting out the past cost of health care services and that  certificate is \"conclusive proof of the past cost of health care  services....\" [27]   The word \"conclusive\" is used only in the second of the  two subsections. Clearly the legislature intended there to be a significant  difference between them. Section 16(1) creates a rebuttable presumption, while  the presumption in s. 16(2) is irrebuttable. This interpretation is  supported by s. 24 of the  Interpretation Act , R.S.B.C. 1996  c. 238 which provides: 24. If an enactment provides  that a document is evidence or proof of a fact, unless the context indicates  that the document is conclusive evidence, the document is admissible in  evidence in any proceeding, and the fact is deemed to be established in the absence  of any evidence to the contrary. [28]  Notwithstanding the filing of a certificate under s. 16(1) of  the  Act , therefore, it is open to the defendants to contest whether all  the health care services claimed in the Minister's certificate are attributable  to the accident. In this case the defendants would argue that a portion of the  plaintiff's health care costs between the time of the accident and the  commencement of the trial are attributable to circumstances or conditions that  pre-existed the accident. [8]     Justice Ehrcke held that the plaintiff’s application  was brought too late in the trial and therefore prejudiced the defendants by  compromising their right to cross-examine the plaintiff’s witnesses and to lead  evidence in respect of the  HCCRA  claim (at para. 31). [9]     The Minister’s Certificate is a relatively short document which I  reproduce in its entirety: Whereas Section 16 of the [ HCCRA ]permits the Minister,  or a person acting on behalf of the Minister, to issue certificates setting  out:  (a)   the health care  services that have been received by a beneficiary or class of beneficiaries and  the health care services that a beneficiary or class of beneficiaries will  likely receive in the future for personal injuries suffered as a result of the  negligence or wrongful act or omission of a wrongdoer; and (b)   the past cost of  health care services, the future cost of health care services, or both,  attributable to personal injury suffered by a beneficiary or a class of  beneficiaries. Therefore the undersigned Brenda Rafter, acting on behalf of  the Minister pursuant to Section 16 of the [ HCCRA ], hereby certifies  that Appendix A attached to this Certificate sets out the health care services  claim for  Sam Woo , …, for personal injuries suffered as a result of the  negligence or wrongful act or omission of a wrongdoer on or about  2015\/02\/17 . The health care services and the costs of the health care  services, as outlined in Appendix A, are complete as of the date of this  certificate, and total  $801,170.12 . [Bold emphasis in original.] [10]     Appendix “A” attached to the Minister’s Certificate comprises a summary  page setting out the total costs for various categories of health care services  and then an itemized computer printout of specific services and the associated  cost. [11]     The original Minister’s Certificate is dated May 9, 2019. Notably, after  the trial but before this hearing, a new certificate dated November 13, 2019,  was produced (the “Revised Certificate”). It has identical wording to the  original Minister’s Certificate, but the total cost figure has increased to  $1,239,420.46. According to the plaintiff, the Revised Certificate includes  some pre-trial services that had been omitted from the original Minister’s  Certificate and also includes a minor amount for costs incurred since January 2019. [12]     The defendant objects to the Minister’s Certificate on the basis that: a)   It does not  comply with s. 16 of the  HCCRA  which requires two certificates, one under  s. 16(1), setting out the health care services received by a beneficiary and a  second under s. 16(2), setting out the past and future costs of health care  services attributable to a personal injury suffered by the beneficiary; b)   It does not  contain the language required by s. 16(1) specifically setting out the health  care services received by a beneficiary, i.e. the plaintiff. Instead, the  Minister’s Certificate purports to set out the “health care services claim” for  the plaintiff; and c)   It  similarly does not contain the language required by s. 16(2) certifying the  past and future costs of health care services attributable to a personal injury  suffered by a beneficiary. Rather, it purports to certify that the “health care  services and the costs of the health care services, …, are complete”. [13]     The defendant submits that these omissions and errors in the Minister’s  Certificate render it inadmissible. In support of their position, the defendant  relies on a number of criminal and quasi-criminal law cases in which courts  have rejected evidentiary certificates, for example breath sample certificates,  that did not strictly comply with the governing legislation:  The Queen v.  Noble , [1978] 1 S.C.R. 632 at 638-39;  R. v. Taylor  (1985), 38 M.V.R.  263 at 267-69 (B.C.C.A);  R. v. Paruk  (1999), 49 M.V.R. (3d) 309 at  paras. 36, 58 (B.C.S.C.).  [14]     The plaintiff submits that s. 16 of the  HCCRA  does not prescribe  a particular form for a certificate nor does it require that there be two  separate certificates under ss. 16(1) and (2). Further, the plaintiff submits  that the facts and information required by s. 16 are in fact set out in the  Minister’s Certificate when the language of the certificate is read in  conjunction with the definitions contained in the  HCCRA . For example,  while the Minister’s Certificate refers to the “health care services claim”, that  phrase is defined in s. 1 as follows: … in relation to personal injury  suffered by a beneficiary, means a claim for the recovery of the past and  future costs of health care services attributable to that personal injury. [15]     The plaintiff also relies on the definitions of “past cost of health  care services” and “future cost of health care services” in s. 1, which are  reproduced at para. 5 above. [16]     The plaintiff submits that when read in its entirety and in light of the  statutory definitions, the Minister’s Certificate contains all of the  information required by ss. 16(1) and (2) of the  HCCRA . [17]     The defendant’s first objection to the Minister’s Certificate is again  that s. 16 of the  HCCRA  requires two separate and distinct certificates.  In support of this position, the defendant points to the fact that s. 16 is  titled “Minister’s certificates” and that, as found by Ehrcke J. in  MacEachern ,  ss. 16(1) and (2) clearly deal with different types of information. The  defendant also contrasts the language of s. 16 with that used in similar  statutes in other provinces, for example the Alberta  Crown’s Right of  Recovery Act , S.A. 2009, c. C-35, and the Manitoba  Health Services  Insurance Act , C.C.S.M., c. H35. The relevant sections of both of those  statutes refer to “one or more” certificates being issued in respect of health  services received by a beneficiary and the cost of those services (Alberta  Act ,  s. 9(1); Manitoba  Act , s. 97(4)). [18]     I do not agree that s. 16 of the  HCCRA  requires two separate  certificates. While ss. 16(1) and (2) again deal with two different types of  information, the sections do not specify that separate certificates are  necessary. Contrary to the submission of the defendant, Ehrcke J. in  MacEachern   did not find that two certificates are required. Rather, as he noted at para. 25,  s. 16 “sets out two different kinds of certificate  evidence ” (emphasis  added). The requirement is one of substance rather than form. In my view, s. 16  does not prohibit the Minister or his\/her designate from including both types  of evidence in a single certificate. [19]     It follows that I do not accept the defendant’s submission that the  Minister’s Certificate is non-compliant with s. 16 of the  HCCRA . The  authorities they cite for the consequences of non-compliance, largely drawn  from the criminal law context, therefore have no application. [20]     The defendant also objects to the Minister’s Certificate on the basis  that it does not contain the information or facts required by ss. 16(1) and  (2). In considering this objection, it is useful to note again what the two  sections require: a)   Section 16(1)  deals with health care services received, or likely to be received in the  future, by a beneficiary as a result of a wrongful act. The certificate creates  a rebuttable presumption that the listed services are attributable to the  wrongful act ( MacEachern  para. 27): b)   Section 16(2)  deals with the costs of the past and future health care services attributable  to the wrongful act and the certificate constitutes conclusive, irrebuttable,  proof of those costs ( MacEachern  at para. 27). [21]     The two different types of information are dealt with separately in s.  16 for good reason. With respect to the health care services addressed in s.  16(1), it is conceivable that a defendant might take issue with whether a  specific service is in fact attributable to the wrongful act in issue, or is  the result of a separate and unrelated cause. Such disputes regularly arise in  the context of special damages claims and claims for cost of future care in  personal injury actions. For this reason, the presumption created by a  certificate issued pursuant to s. 16(1) may be rebutted by evidence to the  contrary. [22]     Information concerning the costs of health care services, which is  addressed in s. 16(2), is of a different nature. As can be seen in the appendix  attached to the Minister’s Certificate, costs are attributed to each specific  health care service provided by an identified health care practitioner. While  there is no evidence on this point, it can fairly be assumed that these costs  are set pursuant to established tariffs and there is little room for debate  about the accuracy of the costs. For this reason, a certificate issued pursuant  to s. 16(2) is deemed to be conclusive proof of the costs. [23]     Returning to the Minister’s Certificate here, I agree with the defendant  that the language used does not track directly with the wording of ss. 16(1)  and (2). It is not clear why that is as it would be relatively straight forward  to simply provide the information in the manner contemplated by ss. 16(1) and  (2) and in the language used therein. [24]     That said, I am satisfied that the somewhat unartfully drafted  Minister’s Certificate nonetheless conveys the information required by ss.  16(1) and (2). As noted, the first paragraph of the Minister’ s Certificate,  after the preamble, certifies that Appendix “A” to the certificate sets out the  “health care services claim” for the plaintiff for “personal injuries suffered  as a result of the negligence or wrongful act or omission of a wrongdoer on or  about 2015\/02\/17” (emphasis removed). [25]     Again, “health care services claim” is defined to mean “a claim for the  recovery of the past and future costs of health care services attributable to  [the specified] personal injury”. The definitions of “past cost of health care  services” and “future cost of health care services” make it clear that the  specified costs are the costs of the health care services attributable to the  personal injury. Further, Appendix “A” to the Minister’s Certificate, which  sets out the various health care services and the associated costs, clearly  identifies the plaintiff as the beneficiary as well as the date of the subject  personal injury. In my view, it is clear to anyone reading the Minister’s  Certificate that it identifies the health care services received by the plaintiff  in respect of the personal injuries that were the subject of this litigation  and the costs of those services, i.e. the information required by ss. 16(1) and  (2). [26]     The defendant seeks to distinguish between a “claim” for recovery of  health care costs, which is what it says is set out in the Minister’s  Certificate, and a certification that the health care services were received by  the plaintiff, which is what is required under s. 16(1). The defendant submits  that the former is in the nature of a pleading whereas the latter is a material  statement of fact. [27]     In the context of the  HCCRA  and the Minister’s Certificate, this  is a distinction without a difference. Under the  HCCRA , the only claim  that may be advanced, either by the beneficiary (ss. 2 and 3) or by the  government (ss. 7 and 8), is for recovery of the costs of health care services received  by the beneficiary that are attributable to a wrongful act. The intent of a certificate  issued under s. 16 is to identify both the relevant services and the associated  costs. By listing the health care services and the costs in the appendix to the  certificate, the Minister or his\/her designate is stating the necessary  material facts. Again, as I noted in para. 25 above, this should be clear to  anyone reading the Minister’s Certificate. [28]     I find that the Minister’s Certificate complies with s. 16 of the  HCCRA   and is therefore admissible. [29]     At the conclusion of the hearing, I indicated that the issue of the  admissibility of the Revised Certificate would be deferred until after I  released these reasons. The parties may make arrangements through Supreme Court  Scheduling for a further appearance to address this issue as well as any other  outstanding matters. “Skolrood  J.”"},"meta":{},"created_at":"2022-03-08T08:08:14.438107Z","updated_at":"2022-03-08T08:08:14.438143Z","project":2}]
