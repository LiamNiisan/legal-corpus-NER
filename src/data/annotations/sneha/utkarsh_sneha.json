Bouchard, 2021 BCCA 45 Date: 20210127 Docket: CA46788 Between: Alan Kendall carrying on business as Al’s Contracting and Silver Creek Log Sort Ltd. Appellants (Plaintiffs) And Michele Bouchard carrying on business as Bouchard & Company and Michele Bouchard Inc. Respondents (Defendants) Before: The Honourable Mr. Justice Tysoe The Honourable Madam Justice Fenlon The Honourable Madam Justice Fisher On appeal from: An order of the Supreme Court of British Columbia, dated March 3, 2020 ( Kendall v. Bouchard, 2020 BCSC 727, Vancouver Docket S145569). Oral Reasons for Judgment Counsel for the Appellants, appearing via videoconference: B. Martyniuk M.B.J. Stainsby Counsel for the Respondents, appearing via videoconference: J. Forsythe Place and Date of Hearing: Vancouver, British Columbia January 27, 2021 Place and Date of Judgment: Vancouver, British Columbia January 27, 2021 Summary: The appellants retained the respondents to provide accounting expertise to help resolve a payment dispute between the appellant and a third party. Based on the respondents’ report, the appellants commenced an action against the third party. The appellants’ counsel in that matter later terminated his retainer and began an action against the parties, alleging flaws in the respondents’ report. The appellants subsequently brought a claim in professional negligence against the respondents. The trial judge dismissed the claim as statute-barred for having been commenced after the limitation period. The appellants challenge the trial judge’s interpretation of the pre-2013 Limitation Act as only requiring knowledge of the facts that could ground a potential claim. Held: Appeal dismissed. The trial judge did not err in her interpretation and application of the Limitation Act. The limitation period begins to run when a party has the facts that, with the appropriate advice, would lead them to reasonably conclude they have a potential claim. The Act imputes the necessary technical advice once the party possesses the underlying facts. It was open to the judge to find that the appellants should have been aware that there was a problem with the respondents’ report when they received their previous counsel’s statement of claim. FENLON J.A. : [1] The appellants appeal the dismissal of their professional negligence claim against the respondents as statute-barred. The main issue on appeal is whether the judge erred in her interpretation and application of the postponement provisions in the pre-2013 Limitation Act, R.S.B.C. 1996, c. 266. [2] The appellant, Mr. Kendall, and his companies, Al’s Contracting and Silver Creek Log Sort Ltd., supplied logs to a sawmill. A dispute arose with the sawmill about who owed money to whom. The appellants retained Ms. Bouchard, who is a Certified Management Accountant, to review the sawmill’s books and to resolve the dispute. [3] From 2000 to 2003, Ms. Bouchard spent 1,000 hours conducting a review. She concluded that the sawmill owed the appellants about $1.7 million. Based on that accounting, the appellants commenced an action against the sawmill to obtain payment. The appellants retained a lawyer, John Frank, on a contingency fee basis in June 2004 to prosecute that claim. Ms. Bouchard agreed to assist Mr. Frank in preparing the case, although she advised the appellants that an expert accountant should be retained to prepare a report, as she did not want to go to court. [4] In January 2007, Mr. Frank terminated his retainer and started an action against the appellants and the respondents, claiming that the contingency fee agreement had been breached. That action was ultimately settled, but the information in the notice of claim played an important part in the judge’s analysis—a matter to which I will return. [5] In 2008, the appellants retained new counsel in the action against the sawmill. Their new counsel, in turn, retained an accounting expert, Mr. Salton, who, in September 2008, identified numerous errors with Ms. Bouchard’s reconstruction of the accounts. [6] The appellants commenced the underlying professional negligence action against Ms. Bouchard and her professional corporation on June 18, 2014. [7] Ms. Bouchard brought a summary trial application to dismiss the appellants’ claim as statute-barred or, in the alternative, on the basis that liability had not been proven. The judge determined the matter was suitable for resolution by way of summary trial. She found the start of the running of the limitation period had been postponed until December 17, 2007, when Mr. Frank filed a statement of claim against the parties to this action, alleging flaws in Ms. Bouchard’s report and her refusal to explain her work to him. Because the appellants in the present case filed the claim against Ms. Bouchard in June 2014, more than six years after receiving that information, the judge found the claim to be statute-barred and dismissed it. [8] There are two grounds of appeal: 1. Did the judge err in holding that the limitation issue was suitable for disposition by summary trial? 2. Did the judge err in interpreting and applying s. 6 of the Limitation Act ? [9] With respect to the first ground of appeal, I see no basis to conclude that the judge erred in determining that this matter was suitable for disposition by summary trial. [10] In addressing the question, she said: [29] The plaintiffs argue that there are conflicting affidavits, and in order to determine any of the matters in issue, including the limitations issue, the court will have to resolve conflicts in the sworn evidence of witnesses and ultimately make credibility findings. [30] I disagree. I fail to see any conflicting evidence with respect to the facts that I need to find in order to determine the limitations issue. In their response to the application, written argument and oral submissions, the plaintiffs pointed to no specific conflicts in the evidence at all and certainly no conflicts relating to limitation issues . [Emphasis added.] [11] On appeal, the appellants identify conflicts in the evidence as to whether Ms. Bouchard had signed a letter setting out her professional opinion on the amounts owed by the sawmill and the extent to which she participated in the subsequent litigation commenced by the appellants against that company. I do not see that these conflicts, identified for the first time on appeal, make the resolution of a limitation defence unsuitable for summary trial—they are peripheral to the facts the judge relied on to decide the limitation period had expired. [12] The second ground of appeal contends the judge erred in her finding of facts and in the interpretation and application of the (admittedly) tortured language of s. 6 of the pre-2013 Limitation Act . That section provides for the postponement of the running of the six-year limitation period if certain criteria are met and reads: 6 (4) Time does not begin to run against a plaintiff or claimant with respect to an action referred to in subsection (3) until the identity of the defendant or respondent is known to the plaintiff or claimant and those facts within the plaintiff’s or claimant’s means of knowledge are such that a reasonable person, knowing those facts and having taken the appropriate advice a reasonable person would seek on those facts, would regard those facts as showing that (a) an action on the cause of action would, apart from the effect of the expiration of a limitation period, have a reasonable prospect of success, and (b) the person whose means of knowledge is in question ought, in the person’s own interests and taking the person’s circumstances into account, to be able to bring an action. (5) For the purpose of subsection (4), (a) “ appropriate advice” , in relation to facts, means the advice of competent persons, qualified in their respective fields, to advise on the medical, legal and other aspects of the facts, as the case may require, (b) “facts” include (i) the existence of a duty owed to the plaintiff or claimant by the defendant or respondent, and (ii) that a breach of a duty caused injury, damage or loss to the plaintiff or claimant, … [13] The appellants make two main arguments. First, they say the judge made an error of fact because she misapprehended the meaning of Mr. Frank’s statement of claim. She found that the pleading identified Ms. Bouchard’s work as faulty, when the paragraphs she relied on only say that Mr. Frank could not understand the reconstruction report. For example, at para. 27 of the statement of claim, they point to Mr. Frank saying that he “was unable to trace accounting information either back from the summary or forward from the original entries to assist in verifying these claims.” [14] The appellants say the pleading does nothing more than flag Mr. Frank’s inability to understand the records in order to support his allegation that the retainer letter was breached by Ms. Bouchard refusing to explain her work and answer his questions. [15] I would, with respect, not accede to this argument. Although couched in terms of Mr. Frank’s inability to understand and follow Ms. Bouchard’s accounting, it was open to the judge on the record before her to infer that Mr. Frank was asserting there was a problem with the report and, in particular, that there was no way to verify the sums Ms. Bouchard had concluded were owing. The problems described by Mr. Frank in his statement of claim were not new to the appellants. Mr. Frank had set out more details of his complaints about Ms. Bouchard in a letter of January 9, 2007, when he terminated his retainer, and Mr. Kendall acknowledged that Mr. Frank’s complaints about not getting information were “always an issue.” As the judge noted, one of the primary claims against Ms. Bouchard in the underlying litigation was that she failed to assist legal counsel. [16] I also note the concerns raised by Mr. Frank in his pleading do not differ significantly from the concerns raised by Mr. Salton in his September 2008 communication, which the appellants acknowledge was sufficient to start the running of the limitation clock. [17] I turn now to the second argument raised on this ground of appeal. The appellants say that they could not have assessed whether they had a reasonable prospect of succeeding against Ms. Bouchard in professional negligence until they were told by an accountant —Mr. Salton—that her conclusions could not be traced back to source documents and verified. They say that did not occur until they received Mr. Salton’s critical comments about Ms. Bouchard’s reconstruction in September 2008, and it was therefore only at that point that the limitation period began to run. [18] In my respectful view, the appellants’ argument is based on a misreading of the section. The critical point is not when a party actually receives advice from an expert that identifies the basis for a claim. It is, rather, the point at which a party has the facts that, taken with appropriate advice, would lead a reasonable person to conclude they had a reasonable prospect of a successful claim. In short, the Act imputes appropriate medical, or legal, or accounting advice to the plaintiff at the point at which they have those facts: Karsanjii Estate v. Roque (1990), 43 B.C.L.R. (2d) 234 (C.A.) at 242. [19] It follows that the judge was correct to focus on the date the appellants had the factual knowledge about Ms. Bouchard’s conduct, rather than the date on which they received advice from an accounting expert, opining that her work could not be verified. In this regard, the judge said: [50] When were the critical facts within the means of knowledge of the plaintiffs? [51] I find that by the time Mr. Frank filed his statement of claim against the plaintiffs in the Frank Action, they knew or ought to have known that there were serious issues with the Reconstruction and Ms. Bouchard’s accounting work more generally. The statement of claim in the Frank Action, filed December 17, 2007, raised the same concerns that form the basis of the plaintiffs’ professional negligence action herein. The statement of claim makes the following allegations: 27. The Plaintiff [Mr. Frank] attempted to identify the individual transactions in the Bouchard accounting that form part of these aggregate claims to identify the underlying documentary or other evidence presumably relied on by Bouchard. With the exception of interest expense, the plaintiff unable to identify any underlying entries in the Bouchard accounting that would assist him in locating underlying evidence and verifying these claims, either in whole or in part. More particularly, the plaintiff was unable to trace accounting information either back from the summary or forward from the original entries to assist in verifying these claims. 28. In addition, the plaintiff was unable to itemize by way of a reconciliation, the difference between the balances shown as owing on Watkins records as at September 2001, the date of the Bouchard accounting, and the claims of Silver Creek and Kendall as shown on the Bouchard summary. This unaccounted for difference was approximately $200,000.00. … [53] I find that upon receipt of the statement of claim in the Frank Action, a reasonable person would have been aware that there was a problem with Ms. Bouchard’s work, and that the shortcomings in her work, namely, its inability to be reconstructed or traced to source documents, meant that it likely could not be relied upon to ground a claim against Watkins in the Watkins Action. [54] The facts known to the plaintiffs or within their means of knowledge were such that, having taken the appropriate advice, they were in a position at that point to have started a claim against Ms. Bouchard and her company for the losses they suffered in pursuing what reasonably looked to be a fruitless claim in reliance on her work. [Emphasis added.] [20] I see no error in the judge’s interpretation and application of the pre-2013 Limitation Act to the facts she found. Accordingly, there is no basis upon which this Court could interfere with her decision. [21] I recognize that this means that the appellants will not be able to pursue what otherwise could be a valid claim against Ms. Bouchard. It is never a satisfying outcome for a plaintiff to find their claim barred by the passage of time. But limitation acts seek to balance rationales oriented towards defendants—the right to be free of suits at some point and to have cases brought diligently when evidence is fresh—with the interests of plaintiffs to have a reasonable period within which to commence an action once they know enough to reasonably do so: Novak v. Bond, [1999] 1 S.C.R. 808 at para. 66. In this case, that balance results in the appellants’ action being barred. I acknowledge that is a frustrating result for the appellants, but it is compelled by the balance the Legislature has struck and the law we must apply. [22] The appeal should be dismissed. [23] TYSOE J.A. : I agree. [24] FISHER J.A. : I agree.

Richmond Taxi Co. Holdings Ltd.,   2021 BCCA 43 Date: 20210201 Docket: CA46504 Between: Ranjit Singh  Ahluwalia Appellant (Plaintiff) And Richmond Taxi Co.  Holdings Ltd. (Duart),    Richmond Taxi Co. Limited (Duart), Richmond Taxi Cabs Ltd.,    Bank of Montreal Respondents (Defendants) Before: The Honourable Mr. Justice Harris (In Chambers) On appeal from: An  order of the Supreme Court of British Columbia, dated    October 18, 2019 ( Ahluwalia v. Richmond Taxi Co. Holdings Ltd. , 2019 BCSC 2189,     New Westminster Docket 201451).  The Appellant, appearing in person with     H. Ahluwalia who translated on his behalf    (via teleconference): R.S. Ahluwalia Counsel for the Respondents     Richmond Taxi Co. Holdings Ltd. and     Richmond Taxi Co. Ltd.    (via teleconference): B.A. Thompson Place and Date of Hearing: Vancouver, British   Columbia January 21, 2021 Place and Date of Judgment: Vancouver, British   Columbia February 1, 2021     Summary: The respondents apply for an  order dismissing the appeal as abandoned for non‑compliance with the filing  deadlines established by the Court of Appeal Rules. The appellant cross applies  for an order extending the time to file appeal materials. Held: Application  granted, cross application dismissed. The chambers judge struck the underlying  claims in this action as being vexatious and barred by the doctrines of res  judicata, cause of action and issue estoppel, and abuse of process. The claims  relate to the same two events that were litigated and finally decided in  actions beginning in 1994. The appeal is devoid of merit and the appellant  did not offer an adequate explanation for the delay in advancing it. The appeal  is dismissed as abandoned.  Reasons for Judgment of the Honourable  Mr. Justice Harris: [1]     The respondents, Richmond Taxi Co. Holdings Ltd. and  Richmond Taxi Co. Ltd., seek an order dismissing the appeal as abandoned. The  appellant, Ranjit Singh Ahluwalia, applies for an extension of time of four  weeks to file an appeal record. [2]     This appeal arises from an order of Justice Marzari in  Chambers dated October 18, 2019 striking out the appellant’s claims  and dismissing his 2018 action against the respondents pursuant to R. 9‑5(1)(b)  and (d) of the  Supreme Court Civil Rules :  Ahluwalia v. Richmond  Taxi Co. Holdings Ltd. , 2019 BCSC 2189. The chambers judge also  found that Mr. Ahluwalia is not entitled to maintain a certificate of  pending litigation on any property on the basis of his claims in the action.  She further allowed two other applications which are not at issue in this  appeal: one for a vexatious litigant order against the appellant pursuant to  s. 18 of the  Supreme Court Act  and another for increased costs  following the appellant’s discontinuation of a 2016 action. [3]     Mr. Ahluwalia filed a Notice of Appeal on November 12, 2019.  To date, he has not filed or served an appeal record, appeal book or factum.  The deadline for the appeal record was January 13, 2020 and the  deadline for the appeal book and factum was February 12, 2020, in  accordance with the  Court of Appeal Rules . [4]     On March 11, 2020, the respondents offered the appellant the  opportunity to late file his appeal record by consent provided this was done by  April 3, 2020. He replied on May 8, 2020, advising them  that he would pursue the appeal when the courts reopened in light of COVID‑19  restrictions in place at that time.  [5]     Mr.  Ahluwalia  has taken no steps since the  suspension of the running of time limits ended on September 13, 2020,  save to apply, in an application filed January 12, 2021, for an  extension of time to file the appeal record. On November 4, 2020, the  applicants put Mr.  Ahluwalia  on notice that they  intended to bring this application and sought dates from him. This application  was filed on December 20, 2020.  [6]     Mr.  Ahluwalia  had not complied with the  time limits to file his appeal record, appeal books or factum even before the  time limits applicable for their filing were suspended on March 18, 2020  in light of the COVID‑19 pandemic. It appears that he filed his motion to  extend time as a reaction to the respondents’ motion to have his appeal  dismissed as abandoned. [7]     The test to determine whether an extension of time should be granted is  the same as the test for whether an appeal should be dismissed as abandoned. It  is set out in  Davies v. C.I.B.C.  (1987), 15 B.C.L.R. (2d) 256  (C.A.): [20] ...First, was there a bona fide intention to  appeal? Second, when were the respondents informed of this intention? Third,  would the respondents be unduly prejudiced by an extension? Fourth, is there  merit in the appeal? And fifth, is it in the interest of justice that an  extension be granted?  ...  [22] The fifth question I  think to be the most important as it encompasses the other four questions and states  the decisive question. … [8]     In my opinion, the critical question before me is whether it is in the  interests of justice to permit this appeal to continue, or to dismiss it as  abandoned. To address that question, I think it is necessary to focus on the lack  of merit in this appeal. I do not suggest that I will exercise my discretion  solely on the basis that the appeal lacks merit, but its lack of merit in  combination with other factors, to which I will turn, leads me to the view that  the appeal should be dismissed as abandoned. [9]     As I have noted, the order under appeal arose out of an application by  the respondents to have the action dismissed in the British Columbia Supreme  Court. This action is one among a series of actions in which Mr.  Ahluwalia  has litigated and relitigated substantially the  same issues. As noted by the judge in describing the issues in the action  before her: [13] The 2018 action  essentially repeats the claims in the 2016 action:  a) First, Mr. Ahluwalia  claims that one or more of the defendants wrongfully seized Cab No. 9 on  August 1, 1998, and failed to return it, and Mr. Ahluwalia seeks an  accounting of the profits from its use. In addition, he seeks to trace the  profits from the seizure of that cab to the purchase of other property,  possibly another cab, and he claims an equitable interest in that property. To  that end, he has filed a certificate of pending litigation (“CPL”) against that  property; and b) Second, Mr. Ahluwalia  alleges the defendants failed to acknowledge him as the sole shareholder or  principal owner of Richmond Cabs and Coral Cabs since 1988, and he seeks orders  that he is entitled to take possession of all their assets and all the profits  derived from the operation of these companies, together with an accounting of  the assets and profits of these companies since 1988. [10]     The judge then undertook a careful and detailed examination of the  complex procedural history arising out of the circumstances just described. I  do not intend to repeat that history here, but I observe that the substance of  these matters were dealt with in 1994 by Madam Justice Newbury (as she  then was) in a 19‑day trial. Her judgment dismissing Mr.  Ahluwalia ’s action was upheld on appeal. There have since  been other proceedings raising either the same issues or issues that ought to  have been raised at the outset. Those proceedings have been dismissed. For  example, in 1997 an action was dismissed as being  res judicata   based on the 1994 trial judgment. [11]     After carefully examining both the substance of the allegations in  previous litigation, and the basis on which they were dealt with by the courts,  the judge identified the issue before her: [56] As I said at the outset of Mr. Ahluwalia’s  submissions and his review of his evidence, my concern in these applications is  not to determine whether his current claims should succeed on their merits, but  whether the claims he advances in the 2018 action arise from the same or a  different set of factual events or circumstances, or different parties, than  the claims he has already advanced in this Court since 1994. It is a lower  threshold that he has to meet than proving the merit of the claims themselves,  but he still has to meet it. [57] To this end, I brought  him back again and again to the question of when he became aware of the claims  he is advancing in the 2018 action and how he says the claims he is advancing  in the 2018 action differ from the claims he was previously advancing and was  unsuccessful with respect to. [12]     The judge then made the following finding: [58] Having gone through  this process, I am confident that Mr. Ahluwalia’s claims continue to arise  from the same two significant events that his previous claims arose from: a) First, his purchase of  shares and his entering into a share agreement with Richmond Cabs, together  with an assignment of rights from Mr. Khan, in 1988 that gave him the  right to drive Cab No. 9 with airport privileges; and  b) Second, the seizure of Cab No. 9  from him in August 1998. [13]     She went on to find: [66] Regardless of the  potential merit of these claims, I agree with the Richmond Taxi Defendants that  these claims fundamentally contradict and seek to undermine the findings of  Newbury J. and the Court of Appeal on essential findings made after a 19-day  trial in 1994. Those proceedings conclusively and finally determined the  fundamental nature of the agreement Mr. Ahluwalia and the other drivers  entered into with Richmond Cabs in 1987 and 1988. [14]     In short,  all of the issues the appellant sought to  advance in the 2018 action had already been decided against him, and he  was barred from advancing them in court by the doctrines of cause of action  estoppel, issue estoppel and abuse of process:  Ahluwalia  at paras. 70–85.  She further found that the 2018 action was a vexatious proceeding:  Ahluwalia   at para. 86. [15]     In my opinion, the proposed appeal is devoid of merit. Neither  in his materials, nor during submissions, did Mr. Ahluwalia identify any  error in the judge’s understanding or characterization of the issues in  previous proceedings, nor the issues he sought to raise in this action. He  provided no foundation to conclude that the judge misapprehended the facts. He  offered nothing to suggest that the judge either misunderstood the law  applicable to the issues before her, or that she misapplied it. Having reviewed  the record, I can detect no arguable error in respect of any of these matters  that is capable of raising the prospect that a division of this Court would  interfere with the judgment. [16]     Mr. Ahluwalia sought to persuade me that he had  located documents that cast a different light on the issues that had previously  been litigated. He suggested that he had new or fresh evidence that he said he  should be able to advance. If he did so, the impediments provided by the  history of previous litigation would fall away. I had no evidence of these  suggestions, but in any event, I do not think there is any prospect that, after  all of these proceedings over many years, a court would in effect reopen  matters that have finally been determined to allow substantially the same  matters to be litigated again. The judge below was alive to these arguments and  clearly spent considerable time trying to tease out of Mr. Ahluwalia  whether there were facts or issues that would take him outside the scope of the  doctrines she was asked to apply. I see no arguable case that the judge erred  in the way she disposed of this aspect of the matter. [17]     In my view, it is in the interests of justice to  dismiss the appeal as abandoned. Timelines have been missed, even before those timelines  were suspended because of the pandemic. I am satisfied that Mr. Ahluwalia  was aware (given his history of applying for extensions in other proceedings)  of the need to comply with timelines for prosecuting an appeal. Mr. Ahluwalia  has registered a certificate of pending litigation, the continuing presence of  which I accept is a prejudice to the respondents. The judge pronounced a  vexatious litigant order against Mr. Ahluwalia. Although, Mr. Ahluwalia  offered some explanation of the delays in prosecuting the appeal, I am not  persuaded that they satisfactorily explain the full extent of the delay. I am  satisfied that Mr. Ahluwalia could have and should have prosecuted this  appeal with greater respect for his obligations than he has displayed. [18]     In my view, it is time to bring this litigation to an  end. In one form or another it has been ongoing since the early 1990s. The  issues that were there to be litigated properly were finally decided many years  ago. In my judgment, the interests of justice compel that the appeal be  dismissed as abandoned. I so order. “The Honourable Mr.  Justice Harris”"},"meta":{},"created_at":"2022-03-10T01:19:20.467643Z","updated_at":"2022-03-10T03:56:46.485583Z","project":3},{"id":61,"annotations":[{"id":67,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"start":0,"end":36,"text":"COURT OF APPEAL FOR BRITISH COLUMBIA","labels":["COURT_NAME"]},"id":"40d407ae-9","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":47,"end":75,"text":"R. v.

Beguin,   2019 BCCA 50 Date: 20190124 Docket: CA45566 Between: Regina Respondent And Devon Skyler Beguin Appellant Before: The Honourable Madam Justice Newbury The Honourable Madam Justice Stromberg-Stein The Honourable Madam Justice Fisher On appeal from: An  order of the Provincial Court of British Columbia, dated   January 24, 2018 ( R. v. Beguin , Vancouver Docket 246189-2-C). Oral Reasons for Judgment The Appellant, appearing in person: D.S. Beguin Counsel for the Respondent: M.A. Mereigh Place and Date of Hearing: Vancouver, British   Columbia January 24, 2019 Place and Date of Judgment: Vancouver, British   Columbia January 24, 2019   Summary: Mr. Beguin was  sentenced to three years and three months’ imprisonment followed by two years’  probation for committing three bank robberies. He appeals his sentence on the  basis that the judge erred in failing to appoint amicus to assist him; erred in  principle and imposed an unfit sentence or imposed a demonstrably unfit  sentence; and erred in failing to credit him an additional 71 days for  pre-sentence custody. Held: appeal allowed to the extent of crediting Mr. Beguin  for an additional 71 days pre-sentence custody, which the Crown concedes.  Appointing amicus would have been inappropriate in this case. The sentencing  judge did not err in principle and the sentence was not demonstrably unfit  given the circumstances of the offences and offender. [1]     STROMBERG-STEIN J.A. : Devon Skyler Beguin entered guilty pleas to  three bank robberies, contrary to s. 344 of the  Criminal Code ,  R.S.C. 1985, c. C‑46, and one ‘face masking’ offence, contrary to  s. 351(2) of the  Criminal Code . These offences occurred over six  days in mid-December 2016. He was sentenced to an effective sentence of three  years and three months’ imprisonment, plus two years’ probation. He was credited  17 months for pre-sentence custody. He appeals, seeking to reduce the custodial  portion of his sentence to two or three years on the basis that the judge erred  in principle. Today he seeks to eliminate the probationary term. In addition,  he seeks a further credit of 71 days for pre-sentence custody. [2]     The Crown seeks to adduce as fresh evidence an affidavit demonstrating Mr. Beguin  is, in fact, entitled to a further credit of 71 days for pre-sentence custody.  The application to adduce fresh evidence is granted.  [3]     The Crown concedes the sentence should be adjusted by 71 days but that  otherwise the appeal should be dismissed, as the sentencing judge committed no  material errors impacting the sentence and the sentence is not demonstrably  unfit.  [4]     An appellate court is constrained on review of a sentence. This Court  will not interfere with a sentence unless (1) the sentencing judge committed an  error in principle, failed to consider a relevant factor, or erroneously  considered an aggravating or mitigating factor that had an impact on sentence;  or (2) the sentence is demonstrably unfit:  R. v. Lacasse , 2015 SCC 64.  [5]     The first robbery occurred on December 18, 2016, and Mr. Beguin was  unmasked. He gave a note to the teller indicating “there is a robbery”. The  note was written on a court document Mr. Beguin had received when he had  been released from custody on December 13, 2016, and it contained Mr. Beguin’s  name and photograph. The teller gave him $200. In the second robbery on  December 20, 2016, he was masked, hooded, gloved, and wore plastic bags on his  feet. He demanded $20,000 to $30,000 but left with $500. In the third robbery  on December 23, 2016, he was masked and hooded and armed with a knife and  pepper spray. He told the teller “This is a robbery”. He received $500.  [6]     He was arrested on December 29, 2016, following reports of erratic  driving and has been in custody since then.  [7]     Mr. Beguin had counsel but chose to represent himself at the  sentencing hearing despite many entreaties from many judges that he should  retain counsel. He sought a sentence of time served or at the low end of the  range suggested by the Crown. The Crown sought a three- to five-year sentence,  which was a low sentence in their estimation given the nature of the offences  and Mr. Beguin’s criminal history. The Crown submitted that in recognition  of Mr. Beguin’s personal history and cognitive disabilities a three-year  sentence would be appropriate.  [8]     Mr. Beguin is 26 years old. He has a grade 10 education. He has a  low IQ. He is unemployed but claims that in the past he worked at a rebar  company. He has a criminal record, commencing as a youth, with 32 prior  convictions including related offences and various breaches of court orders.  The prior convictions are described at para. 18 of the judge’s sentencing  reasons. At the time of these offences, he had just been released for similar  offences for which he had received a three-year sentence and 18 months’  probation.  [9]     The pre-sentence report indicates he lacks insight, has poor problem-solving  skills, has pro-criminal attitudes, and has a history of substance abuse and non-compliance  with court orders. The psychiatric assessment documents a history of mild  mental cognitive impairment and serious substance abuse. He has received a number  of serious psychiatric diagnoses and is considered a high risk to re-offend.  [10]     The sentencing judge noted he had a troubled, abusive, chaotic childhood  and was in foster care. She noted he had been diagnosed with ADHD, fetal  alcohol spectrum disorder, mild mental retardation, antisocial personality  disorder, polysubstance abuse, drug induced psychosis, psychosis not otherwise  specified, schizoaffective disorder, and schizophrenia.  [11]     While in custody, Mr. Beguin has chosen to stay in voluntary  segregation.  [12]     The victims were contacted but did not provide victim impact statements. [13]     The judge noted that the applicable sentencing principles were specific  and general deterrence, denunciation, and protection of the public. She  observed that Mr. Beguin had expressed no interest in rehabilitation when  dealing with the author of the pre-sentence report; however, he told the judge  he was willing to go for counselling in the community and get a job.  Notwithstanding Mr. Beguin’s poor history of compliance with community  supervision, the judge still considered rehabilitation a relevant sentencing  objective. She was live to the fundamental sentencing principle of  proportionality. She weighed the seriousness of the crimes but considered his  moral blameworthiness diminished due to his low intellectual functioning and  other challenges. She recognized he took responsibility for his crimes by  entering guilty pleas, which she weighed heavily as a mitigating factor. She  recognized that the crimes were not sophisticated but noted the level of  violence had escalated as he went from being unmasked, to masked, to masked  with two weapons.  [14]     The judge commented that she needed to impose a fair and fit sentence  that reflected his record. She considered the fact that Mr. Beguin’s last  offences were two robberies for which he had received a three-year sentence and  she was now sentencing him for three robberies. She said that for this reason  alone she had to impose more than a three-year sentence. Therefore, she imposed  a sentence of three years and three months to be followed by two years’  probation. She credited Mr. Beguin with 17 months for pre-sentence custody  as calculated by trial Crown counsel, which meant he had a further 22 months in  custody. [15]     The aggravating features of Mr. Beguin’s offences include the  nature of the offences – targeting vulnerable bank employees while masked on  two occasions and armed on one occasion; his related criminal record; and the  fact that he committed these offences within days of being released and while  on probation for two robberies where he had received a three-year sentence.  [16]     The mitigating features are that he entered guilty pleas to the offences  and his moral blameworthiness is somewhat diminished due to his low  intellectual functioning and other challenges.  [17]     In the trial court, Mr. Beguin discharged his lawyer prior to  sentencing. He has done the same on appeal. This Court has the benefit of his  discharged former lawyer’s sentencing statement for this appeal to which the  Crown has responded in its sentencing statement. One of his grounds of appeal  is that the sentencing judge should have appointed  amicus  to assist him  in making his submissions. In my view, the sentencing judge committed no error  in refusing to appoint  amicus . It is not appropriate to appoint  amicus   in the circumstances. The role of an  amicus  is to assist the court, not  the accused. Further, Mr. Beguin was appointed counsel but chose in the  trial court (and has chosen on appeal) to represent himself. This ground of  appeal has no merit, in my view. [18]     Mr. Beguin has submitted today that his sentence is too long as  compared to other sentences for other crimes. He has given examples of three cases:  two for manslaughter and one for fraud. I do not consider these cases to be of  much assistance to his case. Although he indicated in oral argument that he was  not relying on his counsel’s sentencing statement, we have considered it in his  interests. In that statement, Mr. Beguin suggests the judge erred in  finding that because he was sentenced to three years’ imprisonment for his  prior offences she had to sentence him to more than three years’ imprisonment  for these offences. He says the three-year sentence was, in fact, for five  offences: two robberies, two masking offences, and one offence for mischief.  [19]     R. v. Brogan , 1999 BCCA 278 sets the appropriate range for  robbery with violence at two to nine years. In my view, the judge properly  increased the sentence by three months more than his last sentence for similar  offences because of the aggravating factor of committing the offences within a  few days of being released from custody and while on probation for the prior  robbery offences. As was recognized by the sentencing judge, the sentence she  imposed was on the low end of what would otherwise be an appropriate sentence given  the nature and circumstances of the offences and offender.  [20]     Mr. Beguin suggests the judge improperly considered that he was  masked on the December 28, 2016 robbery because he did not plead guilty to the  masking count on the Information. However, this was an uncontested circumstance  of the offence, which the Crown properly referred to for identification  purposes as well as in the context of relating the circumstances of the offences.   [21]     In my view, there were no errors in principle in the judge’s approach to  sentencing Mr. Beguin that impacted the sentence. The sentences imposed  were fit in the circumstances. This includes both the custodial portion of the  sentence and the probationary term, which Mr. Beguin now, in oral  argument, claims is too long. Nor can it be said that the sentence was  demonstrably unfit. As has been noted, the sentence is at the low end of what is  appropriate in the circumstances. [22]     As I have indicated, the sentencing judge erred with respect to the  calculation of pre-sentence custody credit as a result of information provided  by trial Crown counsel. Crown counsel on appeal concedes that Mr. Beguin  is entitled to a further 71 days’ credit for pre-sentence custody. Therefore,  the sentence will be reduced by 71 days.  [23]     I would allow the appeal to the extent of crediting Mr. Beguin with  a further 71 days for pre-sentence custody. Otherwise, I would dismiss his  appeal. [24]     NEWBURY J.A. : I agree. [25]     FISHER J.A. : I agree. [26]     NEWBURY J.A. : The appeal is allowed to the extent indicated. “The Honourable Madam Justice Stromberg-Stein”"},"meta":{},"created_at":"2022-03-10T01:19:20.467576Z","updated_at":"2022-03-10T03:53:42.412702Z","project":3},{"id":59,"annotations":[{"id":65,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"start":0,"end":36,"text":"COURT OF APPEAL FOR BRITISH COLUMBIA","labels":["COURT_NAME"]},"id":"40d3e1f1-9","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":47,"end":84,"text":"Sharifpour v.

Rostami , 2018 BCSC 681, Kelowna Docket  E103131). Oral Reasons for Judgment The Appellant Cyrous Sharifpour, appearing in person: C. Sharifpour The Respondent Parisa Rostami, appearing via   teleconference: P. Rostami Place and Date of Hearing: Vancouver, British   Columbia February 4, 2019 Place and Date of Judgment: Vancouver, British   Columbia February 4, 2019   Summary: The appellant seeks an order  waiving the requirement that the appellant must file a transcript of the trial  testimony. Held: Application dismissed. The appellant is given leave to amend  his factum by February 28 to reduce the need for a full transcript. Any issues  concerning the contents of the transcript following such amendment are referred  to the registrar for settlement. The time for filing the respondent’s factum  does not begin to run until the contents of the transcript have been settled. [1]     HUNTER J.A. : The appellant in what the trial judge described as acrimonious  matrimonial proceedings applies for an order waiving the requirement that he  file a transcript of the trial evidence. The trial extended over 19 days and  the appellant has been given an estimate of $20,000 for the transcript. He  advises that he cannot afford to pay this sum, and says that he does not intend  to rely on the oral testimony from the trial, but on the documentary evidence  he has filed and prepared. Both he and the respondent are acting on their own  behalf. [2]     The requirement to file a transcript is statutory. Section 16 of the  Court  of Appeal Act,  R.S.B.C. 1996, c. 77,   requires that the  appellant must file an appeal book and a transcript in accordance with the  Court’s rules. Rule 20(1) of the  Court of Appeal Rules,  B.C. Reg.  297\/2001   sets out this requirement in greater detail: 20 (1) If oral testimony was presented in the court appealed  from, the appellant must, within 60 days after bringing the appeal, a) obtain a transcript of the oral  testimony, b) file one paper copy of that  transcript for use by the court plus such additional paper copies as are  required for the purposes of paragraph (d), c) file one electronic copy of the  transcript, d) serve one filed paper copy of  the transcript on each of the other parties, and e) serve on each party who requests it an electronic copy of  the transcript. [3]     While only one copy of the paper transcript need be filed with the  Court, the parties must also file four copies of a transcript extract book  containing any portions of the oral testimony relied upon in that party’s  factum: Rule 27. [4]     The Court is aware that the cost of a transcript can be an impediment to  bringing an appeal, and the Court’s rules provide two mechanisms for reducing  that burden. A single justice such as myself may exclude any testimony from the  transcript in accordance with Rule 20(5), and the registrar of the Court has  the authority under Rule 26.1 to settle the contents of the transcript. [5]     Registrar Outerbridge has reviewed the considerations that affect the  exclusion of portions of the transcript in  Foote v. Canada Revenue Agency ,  2016 BCCA 188. As he noted, the purpose of requiring a transcript of the  evidence is to ensure that the Court will have a proper record of the  proceedings from which appeals are taken:  Pavlis v. HSBC Bank Canada ,  2009 BCCA 450 at para. 8. [6]     Depending on the issues to be addressed in the appeal, it may be  possible to reduce the bulk of the transcript that is required, and even to  eliminate the need for a transcript of the evidence, although it is seldom that  an appeal is framed so narrowly that no transcript at all is required. [7]     The appellant’s statement that he does not intend to rely on the oral  evidence from the trial is not relevant to the question of excluding evidence  from the transcript. What is significant is the manner in which the appeal is  framed, and whether recourse to the oral evidence may be required by the Court  in its consideration of the appeal. Registrar Outerbridge addressed this issue  in this way in  Foote : [12] It is a misconception that an appellant need only  obtain those portions of the transcript that are necessary to advance arguments  within their factum and then leave a respondent to obtain whatever else they  require at their expense. This position was taken by the appellants at the  appointment.  [13] The appellants’  responsibility, as noted in  Pavlis , is to ensure the transcript is  sufficient to allow an appeal to be considered in its proper context. They are  charged with the responsibility and expense of obtaining the transcript in the  discharge of that obligation, given it is their appeal. Where there is a  dispute or the parties are unsure, they may settle the transcript before the  Registrar or limit the contents of the transcript before a Justice. [8]     In this appeal, there is no possibility of hearing the appeal as it is  being advanced by the appellant without recourse to the evidence at trial. This  conclusion flows from the issues the appellant wishes to canvas on appeal. The  notice of appeal, for example, lists 17 grounds for appeal, virtually all of  which are allegations of error in the manner in which the trial judge treated  the evidence. The appellant has filed his factum, and Part 2 of the factum  identifies 18 allegations of error by the trial judge. The allegations are  framed almost entirely in terms of the judge’s assessment of the evidence,  including allegations such as the trial judge “committed a palpable error in  finding that…”, “…failed to adequately consider the evidence that…”, “erred on  the evidence that…”, and “erred on the evidence and committed a palpable error  in finding that…”. [9]     In an earlier judgment concerning the filing of appeal books and factum,  Justice Garson described this proceeding as “a fact-intensive, complicated  trial”: 2018 BCCA 397 (Chambers) at para. 14. I agree with that  characterization. It is perhaps inevitable than an appeal of such a trial will  be laden with allegations of factual error. But that is the kind of appeal  where a transcript is most necessary. [10]     Justice Saunders recently dealt with a similar application in  Agent E  v. Canada (Attorney General),  2018 BCCA 492 (Chambers), review dismissed  2018 BCCA 491. In considering the need for a full transcript, Saunders J.A.  referred with approval to the judgment in  Brazeau v. International  Brotherhood of Electrical Workers , 2004 BCCA 333, in which Justice Low made  these comments: [5] In most appeals the panel members hearing the  appeal will wish to have the evidence given by the witnesses available to them.  In the present case the appellant argues that no transcripts are necessary  because the basis of the appeal is that the trial judge erred in applying the  law as to the facts that she found and which are now undisputed. Although this  position is attractive in the interests of lessening the volume of the record,  I am not persuaded that the court will not need the transcripts. [6] I confess that I am approaching the issue  cautiously, but this is a fact-rich case, and I can foresee that members of the  panel hearing this appeal will likely wish to have access to the evidence to  learn the context in which significant findings of fact were made,  notwithstanding that those findings of fact are not in dispute. [7] It is not enough, in  my opinion, to dispense with transcripts simply because it is not contended  that the trial judge made any factual errors by misapprehending the evidence or  disregarding important evidence therefore making a palpable and overriding  error. [11]     This case also is a fact-rich case. Unlike the  Brazeau  judgment,  the appellant in this case does contend that the trial judge made factual  errors by misapprehending or disregarding important evidence. As presently  framed, this appeal requires a full transcript to be filed. I am not prepared  to waive the requirement of a transcript. [12]     It may be possible to revise the factum in such a way as to identify  legal issues that do not require a full factual record. I am skeptical that  this can be done without the assistance of counsel, but I am prepared to give  the appellant leave to file an amended factum if he wishes to try to reframe  the appeal in such a way that the appeal is based on legal issues arising from  the trial judge’s judgment and not purely factual matters. If he wishes to do  so, he may file an amended factum no later than February 28, 2019. I strongly  recommend that both parties seek legal assistance in the preparation of their  factums.  [13]     If the appellant elects not to file an amended factum by February 28,  2019, the application to waive the requirement of filing a transcript of all  the oral evidence presented at trial will stand dismissed. [14]     If the appellant does file an amended factum but the parties still  cannot agree on any exclusions from the evidence required to be included in the  transcript, I direct that the contents of the transcript be settled by the  registrar pursuant to Rule 26.1. Until this has been done, this appeal cannot  proceed. The time for filing a respondent’s factum will be extended, and will  not begin to run until a transcript either agreed upon by the parties or  settled by the registrar has been filed and served. The time for filing the  respondent’s appeal book will be extended in the same way. [15]     Accordingly, I make the following order: (i) the appellant’s application for an order waiving  the requirement to file a transcript of the oral testimony presented at the  trial is dismissed; (ii) the appellant has leave  to file an amended factum no later than February 28, 2019; (iii) if the appellant does file an amended factum and  the parties still are unable to agree on exclusions from the transcript, the  contents of the transcript are to be settled before the registrar; (iv) the time limits for the filing of the respondent’s  factum and appeal book will not begin to run until a transcript either agreed  upon by the parties or settled by the registrar has been filed and served; (v) until the determination of the need to file a full  transcript or a transcript with exclusions of evidence has been resolved,  either by agreement of the parties or by settlement by the registrar, this  appeal cannot be set down for hearing; and (vi) the respondent is entitled to her costs of this  application. “The Honourable Mr. Justice Hunter”"},"meta":{},"created_at":"2022-03-10T01:19:20.467451Z","updated_at":"2022-03-10T03:46:35.680798Z","project":3},{"id":55,"annotations":[{"id":61,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"start":3,"end":40,"text":"THE SUPREME COURT OF BRITISH COLUMBIA","labels":["COURT_NAME"]},"id":"40d393ee-9","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":51,"end":114,"text":"Brewis v.

January 7, 2020 Place and Date of Judgment: Penticton, B.C. January 7, 2020   [1]     THE COURT:  The petitioner, Mr. William James Brewis, filed  this petition on November 19, 2019 seeking, essentially, an interest in  property that is registered in the names of the respondents WSR Holdings ULC  Inc. and WCR Holdings ULC Inc. Mr. Brewis claims to be entitled to  ownership of those lands through a land trust that he claims is created by  operation of law. [2]     In his various written submissions that were filed and are contained  within a copious set of documents, in a trial binder of some 42 tabs, he states  the main issue in the petition is “assumption of the continued acceptance to  the land trust and the legal status as tenant for life, which will continue to  be assumed as such until determined otherwise within the jurisdiction of a  judge or a senior court within English law”. [3]     He says, “This requisition is for the court's determination based on the  doctrine of remitter, a redress that operates by operation of law to the land  trust as established by s. 16 of the  Settled Land Act 1925 ”. [4]     He then says a secondary issue is the determination of his past,  current, and future rights as settlor, with specific performance concerning the  duties and powers to the land trust in order to send a Supreme Court of B.C.  determination that justifies the notice already sent to those in possession of  the land trust assets who have failed to respond in regards to determining the  matter as required by the  Settled Land Act . [5]     He says he is the settlor of a trust of the subject properties, which he  now seeks to revoke. Those properties are owned by WSR Holdings ULC and WCR  Holdings ULC. They are registered owners under the  Land Title Act . [6]     He suggests that his claim involves established legal concepts such as  the common law; the  Settle Land Act , which is an English statute; and  that he has somehow become the settlor of a trust that he now wants to abandon.  He cites numerous legal authorities and case law, legislation, academic and  reference text, none of which apply to his argument. [7]     He has not satisfied me, even remotely, that he is the settlor of any  trust or, indeed, that there is any trust established in the first place. [8]     His submissions have no basis in law and simply make no sense. I am  amply satisfied that his arguments are in the nature of the methodologies  adopted by the Organized Pseudolegal Commercial Argument litigants, otherwise  known as OPCAs, as were discussed by Associate Chief Justice Rooke in  Meads  v. Meads , 2012 ABQB 571. [9]     His arguments distort and misapply recognized legal principles and  rules. They are illogical, incoherent, and delusional. They are wholly  rejected. Accordingly, the petition is dismissed. [10]     I note, from the response filed by WSR Holdings and WCR Holdings that  costs in the nature of special costs are being sought. [11]     Mr. Brewis swore an affidavit stating that he is age 46 and he is  of sound mind and body. I infer from that that he must have known this action  had no possible hope of success and was doomed from the outset. Its dismissal will  come as no surprise. He has been amply warned by, in particular, Mr. Dalmyn  on behalf of the Attorney General of British Columbia who succinctly and  clearly set out why his claim would fail in a letter addressed to Mr. Brewis  dated December 4, 2019. He simply chose to ignore the obvious. [12]     In my view, the petitioner’s conduct, in bringing this illegitimate and ill-conceived  petition, is worthy of sanction, particularly as I have concluded that it was  brought in the nature of an OPCA claim, the concepts and schemes of which this  court and courts across Canada have consistently rejected. [13]     A special costs award that indemnifies an innocent party has merit where  that party faces the type of litigation the respondents faced here. It  satisfies the objectives of deterrence and punishment that would otherwise be  served by a punitive damage award. The misconduct in this case relates to the  fact that Mr. Brewis had no reasonable basis to commence or continue this  litigation. [14]     In my view, justice can only be done by an order for special costs. I  therefore order one set of special costs, payable by the petitioner to the  respondents WSR Holdings ULC Inc. and WCR Holdings ULC Inc. [15]     Special costs are being ordered not only as a sanction for the petition’s  lack of merit but as a strong deterrent either to the petitioner or to others  who are of like mind from launching similar frivolous proceedings. The  petitioner must understand the consequences of these types of proceedings:  Dempsey  v. Envision Credit Union , 2006 BCSC 1324, at paras. 46 and 48; and  CIBC v. Marples, 2008 BCSC 590, at paras. 3, 4, and 7. [16]     Now, subject to any submissions from you, Mr. Dalmyn, I do not  propose to order costs payable to the Attorney General, because it is unusual  to do so in cases like this, but I will hear submissions if you wish. [17]     MR. DALMYN: I’m not going to make a submission on that, My Lord.  The Attorney General, in administrative law cases and constitutional cases,  does not seek costs and is normally quite concerned when costs are sought  against the Attorney General. This is a hybrid case. The Attorney General’s  appearance in this matter was necessitated by Mr. Brewis’ very deep  misconceptions and wishful thinking about a solution to his poverty. It’s not a  situation -- he wasted the time of correspondence unit and has wasted some of  my time, but that is one of the Attorney General’s functions. [18]     THE COURT: All right. Well, thank you for that, Mr. Dalmyn. [19]     There will also be an order that the requirement that Mr. Brewis  sign the order I have made, which I will ask Ms. Metherell to draft, be  dispensed with. [20]     Anything further? [21]     MS. METHERELL: No, thank you, My Lord. [22]     THE COURT: Thank you both. We are adjourned. “G.P. Weatherill J.”"},"meta":{},"created_at":"2022-03-10T01:19:20.467202Z","updated_at":"2022-03-10T01:24:58.241711Z","project":3},{"id":77,"annotations":[{"id":83,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"start":3,"end":40,"text":"THE SUPREME COURT OF BRITISH COLUMBIA","labels":["COURT_NAME"]},"id":"40d3b9b4-9","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":51,"end":86,"text":"Javorovic v.

Booth,   2021 BCSC 232 Date: 20210106 Docket: M193504 Registry:  New Westminster Between: Enida Amalija  Burnard   also known as Enida Amalija Javorovic Plaintiff And Teresa Lee Booth Defendant Before:  The Honourable Mr. Justice Gomery Oral Ruling  (Re Admissibility of Portions of Expert Report)  In  Chambers Counsel for the Plaintiff: S.L. Kovacs    J. Malhi Counsel for the Defendant: K. Armstrong, Q.C. Place and Date of Hearing: New Westminster, B.C. January 5, 2021 Place and Date of Judgment: New Westminster, B.C. January 6, 2021   [1]     Counsel seek a ruling concerning the admissibility of parts of the  expert report of Raph Kowalik. The report is to be tendered by the defendant  in response to the plaintiff's expert report of Dominic Shew. Mr. Shew is an  occupational therapist whose reports provide a functional capacity evaluation  and recommendations for the cost of future case. Mr. Kowalik is similarly  qualified.  [2]     Ms. Kovacs helpfully confines her objections to specified portions of  Mr. Kowalik's report and has identified those portions in a blacklined version  of the report. By way of overview, she rests her objections on three grounds: 1. She  submits that in a responsive report, Mr. Kowalik should confine himself to  criticizing Mr. Shew's opinions based on the assumed facts contained in Mr.  Shew's report and should not be referring to additional factual assumptions  contained in an expert report of Dr. Masri tendered by the defendant that was  not available to Mr. Shew when he prepared his report. 2. She  submits that Mr. Kowalik's report sometimes crosses the line from expert  opinion to advocacy and comingles assumed facts with opinions. 3. She  submits that passages in Mr. Kowalik's report fail to satisfy the fundamental  prerequisite to the admission of expert opinion evidence that it be necessary  to assist the court in drawing inferences. [3]     Mr. Armstrong, Q.C., submits that the authorities make it clear that a  responsive expert report need not simply rebut the first expert's reasoning.   Its proper purview is to address issues raised by the first expert, citing  Luedecke  v. Hillman , 2010 BCSC 1538, at paragraphs 52 and 53. He submits that Mr.  Kowalik's report does not cross the line from opinion into advocacy and that  the passages objected to provide an explanation of Mr. Kowalik's reasoning in  offering opinions in respect of issues raised by Mr. Shew. [4]     I do not agree with Ms. Kovacs that it is improper to base a responding  expert report on new or different factual assumptions than those contained in  the prior expert report. The point of expert evidence is to assist the court  in drawing inferences based on expected primary findings of fact. These  primary findings may be based on evidence tendered by either side. If Dr. Masri's  expert report reveals an assumed fact that places the inferences drawn in Mr.  Shew's report in a different light, there is nothing wrong with pointing that  out in a responsive report.  [5]     Ms. Kovacs acknowledges that Dr. Masri's report was properly served and  she is not objecting to it. In that light, I do not think it is objectionable  per se that Mr. Kowalik has relied upon it. In addressing Ms. Kovacs' specific  objections, I bear in mind the following: (a) As required  by Rule 11-2(2), Mr. Kowalik has certified that he is aware of his duty to  assist the court and not be an advocate for any party and that he has prepared  his report in conformity with his duty. (b) It is  not advocacy for an expert to identify the facts upon which she relies and to  state her reasoning clearly and logically even though the effect may be  persuasive. (c) The  proper concern of expert evidence is the drawing of inferences, not making  findings of primary fact. It falls outside the proper scope of expert opinion  for the expert to offer reasons why the trier of fact should make certain  findings of primary fact. (d) Redacting  an expert report to remove objectionable passages is often appropriate,  Maras  v. Seemore Entertainment Limited , 2014 BCSC 1109. However, it is not  appropriate to redact passages where the redaction would obscure or distort the  expert's reasoning. [6]     Mr. Kowalik disagrees with Mr. Shew's opinion that Ms. Javorovic's work  as a postal service manager requires heavy lifting with reference to a certain  referenced standard. Mr. Kowalik gives three reasons for disagreeing. Ms.  Kovacs objects to the third reason.  [7]     The third reason is that Ms. Javorovic may obtain the assistance of  coworkers. While this is clearly an assumption, it is not identified as such  and Ms. Kovacs is right to say that it should have been. This is the kind of  deficiency that can be addressed, if necessary, through cross-examination and I  would not strike the passage on this ground alone.  [8]     It is not improper for Mr. Kowalik to state the basis for his opinion.   Ms. Kovacs is quite not objecting to the opinion itself. I think it would  distort that opinion to redact a part of the underlying reasoning. It will be  open to Ms. Kovacs to challenge the opinion through cross-examination or in  argument on various grounds. [9]     Mr. Kowalik criticizes conclusions drawn by Mr. Shew in a table  comparing Ms. Javorovic's job requirements with her demonstrated abilities. He  suggests that, properly conducted, the comparison indicates that Ms. Javorovic  is able to meet the demands of her job. Ms. Kovacs objects to the concluding  sentence of the paragraph which states, \"This is consistent with Ms.  Javorovic being capable of working at her job for years following her subject  MVA.\"  [10]     I agree with Ms. Kovacs that the concluding sentence steps over the line  from opinion into advocacy. It is an attempt to persuade me to make a finding  of primary fact. This sentence should be struck. [11]     Mr. Kowalik identifies the question of causation as one bearing on Mr.  Shew's recommendations concerning the cost of future care. He quotes from Dr. Masri's  report and suggests that, based on Dr. Masri's opinion, Mr. Shew's recommendations  overstate the cost of future care attributable to the accident that is the  subject of this action.  [12]     In my opinion, this is appropriate opinion in a responsive report. At  the end of the day, it will be only helpful if and to the extent that I accept  Dr. Masri's opinion and the defendant's argument based on that opinion, but  that is no reason not to admit it in evidence.  [13]     Ms. Kovacs refers to a sentence containing a parenthetical observation  concerning a conclusion drawn in a plaintiff's expert report that will not be  tendered in evidence. This sentence is unhelpful and should be struck. [14]     In the paragraph beginning at line 120, Mr. Kowalik gives reasons for  disagreeing with Mr. Shew's recommendation that Ms. Javorovic receive  vocational counselling and possible retraining. Ms. Kovacs objects to two  sentences drawing an inference based on Dr. Masri's report that Ms. Javorovic  does not need to consider retraining at this time. In my opinion, this is an  appropriate opinion in a responsive report. [15]     Mr. Shew anticipates that Ms. Javorovic will incur costs of future care  in connection with anticipated future surgeries. Mr. Kowalik states that based  on Dr. Masri's opinion, such costs may be incurred. It not inappropriate for  Mr. Kowalik to refer to Dr. Masri's opinion and identify its implications for  Mr. Shew's recommendations. Mr. Kowalik begins the sentence in question with  the words, \"I caution the reader….\". I do not think that this verbal  formula is any more objectionable than \"I note that…\" or \"The  reader may wish to consider ….\" In substance, Mr. Kowalik has not  descended into inappropriate advocacy.  [16]     To summarize, two sentences should be struck from Mr. Kowalik's report:   the final sentence of paragraph 2 at line 82 to 84 and the sentence at lines  123 to 125. Otherwise, I dismiss the objection. “Gomery  J.”"},"meta":{},"created_at":"2022-03-10T01:19:20.468705Z","updated_at":"2022-03-10T01:19:20.468712Z","project":3},{"id":76,"annotations":[{"id":82,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"start":3,"end":40,"text":"THE SUPREME COURT OF BRITISH COLUMBIA","labels":["COURT_NAME"]},"id":"Co25YQ4kzH","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":51,"end":109,"text":"Green v.

THE SUPREME COURT OF BRITISH COLUMBIA Citation: Green v. Canada (Public Prosecution Service), 2019 BCSC 46 Date: 20190116 Docket: S101091 Registry: Victoria Between: Ian Earl Green Plaintiff And: Public Prosecution Service of Canada, Ministry of Public Safety and Solicitor General, Province of British Columbia, Vancouver Police Department, Victoria Police Department, Regina Defendants Corrected Judgment: Counsel’s information on page 2 of the judgment was corrected on February 8, 2019 Before: The Honourable Justice Young Reasons for Judgment The Plaintiff Appearing in Person: I. E. Green Counsel for the Public Prosecution Service of Canada and the Department of Justice, British Columbia Region: S. M. Repas Counsel for the Ministry of Public Safety and Solicitor General, Province of British Columbia and Regina: L. F. de Lima Counsel for the City of Vancouver: K.F.W. Liang Counsel for the City of Victoria: R. Macquisten Place and Date of Trial\/Hearing: Victoria, B.C. January 8, 2019 Place and Date of Judgment: Victoria, B.C. January 16, 2019 [1] The Ministry of Public Safety and Solicitor General for the Province of British Columbia and Regina (collectively the “Province”) apply to court to have this action dismissed against the Province for want of prosecution pursuant to Rule 22-7(7) of the Supreme Court Civil Rules. Alternatively, the Province seeks a summary trial on the issue of the expiration of the limitation period to be heard independently from other issues in the action pursuant to Rule 5-3(1)(p) and 12-5(67) and for an order that the action be dismissed against the Province pursuant to Rule 9-7 of the Rules. [2] The Public Prosecution Service of Canada as represented by the Attorney General of Canada (collectively “Canada”) seeks the same orders. [3] Counsel for the City of Vancouver and for the City of Victoria appear as interested parties seeking to have the action dismissed against all parties. [4] Mr. Green was served with these applications and did file affidavits in response. I have checked the court registry and his response was not filed. Mr. Green was declared a vexatious litigant earlier this year and must obtain leave to file documents in court. He applied by requisition to file numerous documents in the previous few months and his requests have been denied. The documents he sought to file do not remain on the file. It is possible that one of the documents was his response to this application. Nonetheless, he was able to file and serve his affidavits and he relied on them in his oral submissions in court. Accordingly, I allowed the application to proceed. [5] This action was commenced by Mr. Green on March 18, 2010. His complaints arise from charges against him from February 12, 2004 for possession and trafficking of a controlled substance and from his arrest in March 2006 and subsequent incarceration. He complains that he was mistreated by being housed in the same cell as a person known to be a sex offender. As a result he was falsely accused (presumably by other inmates) of being a sex offender himself. Presumably his claim is against the Province for breach of a duty of care it owed to him. [6] He complains that while in custody he was subjected to repeated abusive acts by recurrent awakening while he was attempting to sleep. I assume that he is alleging that guards kept waking him. He claims that he was robbed of his medication but does not say by whom. He was refused a vegan meal. He was kept in segregation. He accused the defendants of “double bunking” segregated prisoners. While he was incarcerated, he alleges that the prison guards were slow to provide him with his medication. On August 9, 2006 he and another prisoner were removed from segregation and placed in general population. He alleges that this demonstrated moral turpitude and malice. [7] I am using Mr. Green’s language because it is difficult to paraphrase it as it is not clear to me what legal cause of action he is alleging. [8] Mr. Green claims to have been assaulted viciously in contravention with the Criminal Code by David Paul Graham on September 13, 2006. He does not identify who David Paul Graham is in his pleading. [9] He claims he was not provided medical treatment and was left to suffer. I assume that is by the prison guards, but it is not clear that this happened in jail. [10] The plaintiff claims that he now endures the social stigma of a (falsely accused) sex offender leaving him a social pariah. He suffers headaches from injuries from assaults caused to him in prison and he is now homeless. He suffers a long-term psychiatric disorder due to the stress of being misidentified as a sex offender. [11] On or about February 25, 2010, a female resident who resided below the plaintiff allegedly called the plaintiff a “skinner”. On or about December 3, 2010, an unknown female allegedly publicly identified him as having been in a psychiatric hospital. [12] This is not an application to strike pleadings. Such an application would likely succeed. This is an application to strike for want of prosecution. In short, Mr. Green has not prosecuted this claim for 8 years. [13] When asked why he did not take steps in his lawsuit, the plaintiff described other lawsuits which were either unrelated or peripherally related to this lawsuit. He advised the court that he is homeless and that he had his computer stolen which makes it difficult for him to do his legal research and prepare his legal documents. [14] The writ of summons was filed on March 18, 2010. The Province filed an appearance on March 22, 2010. The Province filed a statement defence on April 8, 2010. The Province stated in its statement of defence that it had not been properly named as the Minister of Public Safety and Solicitor General, Province of British Columbia and Regina are not legal entities and cannot be sued. The Province pleaded s. 7 of the Crown Proceeding Act , RSBC 1996, c. 89. [15] The Province also pleaded the Limitation Act , SBC 2012, c. 13 and that the plaintiff’s claim was barred by the expiration of time. [16] On April 14, 2010, Canada filed an appearance and on April 21, 2010, Canada filed a statement of defence. In Canada’s statement of defence, Canada pleaded that the wrong party had been sued. The Public Prosecution Service of Canada and Regina are not legal entities. Canada relied on s. 23 of the Crown Liability and Proceedings Act, RSC 1985, c. C-50. Canada pleaded that the plaintiff’s claims were barred by the expiration of time pursuant to the Limitation Act . Canada denied any mistreatment of the plaintiff while he was in jail. Both Canada and the Province denied disseminating any information maligning the plaintiff’s character. [17] On March 20, 2018, eight years after filing the writ of summons and statement of claim, the plaintiff applied to reopen the case and sought an order renewing his indigent status. He was granted indigent status. He did not file a notice of intention to proceed. No further steps were taken in this action. [18] As an aside, the plaintiff had commenced several other actions which have been dismissed over the past three years. On February 9, 2018, Mr. Justice MacKenzie declared that Mr. Green was a vexatious litigant. Mr. Green appealed that decision, but failed to file material in time and the appeal did not proceed. [19] The test for dismissal for want of prosecution is set out in Irving v. Irving , [1982] B.C.J. No. 970 (C.A.) approved of in PMC Builders and Developers Ltd. v. Country West Construction Ltd ., 2009 BCCA 535. The applicant must satisfy the court that there has been: (1) inordinate delay; (2) inordinate delay is inexcusable; (3) inordinate delay has caused or is likely to cause some serious prejudice to the applicant in that the applicant will be denied fair trial; and (4) on a balance of justice between the parties action should be dismissed; [20] The Province and Canada submit that, where a case involves serious allegations against the credit and character of a defendant, there is a higher onus to pursue relief diligently. The plaintiff has accused the Province and Canada of torturing him, demonstrating malice and moral turpitude, intentionally breaching regulations of the Correction Act of British Columbia, fabricating evidence and conspiring to smear him. These are serious allegations. [21] I am to look at the overall delay. The incidents giving rise to the allegations arose in 2006, some 12 to 13 years ago. From the start of the proceeding, there was an eight-year gap before any action was taken. The only action that was taken was to apply for indigent status. No further positive steps were taken in the litigation. [22] I find that the delay is inexcusable. I reviewed the affidavits of Mr. Green and I gave him every opportunity during the hearing to tell me why he had done nothing for eight years in this litigation. All he could do is recite what occurred in other cases or the fact that his rights were being challenged. He is certainly passionate about the law and about the Charter , but he was unable to answer my questions directly. The only evidence which has any remote relevance to the question is the fact that his computer was stolen and he is homeless. [23] I accept that those two factors would cause delay; however, I cannot accept the fact that those two factors caused eight years of delay. During that time the plaintiff was pursuing other litigation despite his homelessness. Had he intended to proceed with this litigation, he could have used public library services or even handwritten documents and filed them. He has handwritten some requisitions in the past. I asked if he was busy with other litigation, but he did not present that as an explanation for delay. My conclusion is there is no evidence of a reasonable excuse for an eight-year delay. [24] The allegations made against Canada and the Province are against prison employees who may not still be employees and who have not been identified by Mr. Green. The events complained of occurred between 11 and 14 years ago. It is highly unlikely witnesses would recall any of the events if they occurred. [25] I have found the delay inordinate and inexcusable and as a result a rebuttable presumption of prejudice arises: Busse v. Robinson Morelli Chertkow , 1999 BCCA 313 (“Busse”) at para. 18. Mr. Green has not rebutted the presumption of prejudice. [26] In the end, I am to balance the justice between the parties. Certainly dismissing his action will prejudice the plaintiff; however, I am mindful of the fact that most of the allegations he raises appear to be allegations of negligence for events which occurred in 2006 primarily. He waited for four years to bring the action and so it is highly likely that his claims of negligence were statute-barred. There are some allegations against individual females arising in 2010, but they are not alleging any cause of action known in law. The females are not identified. The allegations against some are calling Mr. Green a “skinner” and calling Mr. Green someone who has been in a psychiatric institute. Neither of these claims could succeed as currently pleaded. This litigation appears to have little chance of success and should be dismissed. [27] As a result of my findings, it is not necessary for me to consider the summary trial or severance of the issues of liability and damages. [28] The City of Vancouver and the City of Victoria appeared as interested parties because the police departments in those cities have been named as litigants. The City of Vancouver is not on the record because the named defendant Vancouver Police Department is not a legal entity. Police forces are not legal entities that can sue or be sued: V.H. v. British Columbia (Attorney General) , 2005 BCSC 139. [29] In his statement of claim, Mr. Green does not differentiate his claims as between the Province, Canada and the two police departments. None of these claims appears to have merit and I find it is in the interest of justice to dismiss the entire action. [30] The Province and Canada seek a nominal order for costs against the claimant who is a homeless man and who has proven to be indigent. That order was granted March 27, 2018 and is still in force. Although the order does not prevent an order for costs to be made against a litigant in this case, I see note no point in making such an award. [31] After completing these reasons and preparing them for release, a Justice of this Court brought to my attention a requisition filed by Mr. Green on December 27, 2018 in this action, seeking leave to file two affidavits sworn on the same day and an unfiled Notice of Application seeking the following orders in this application: 1. Her Majesty the Queen in Right of British Columbia to be found scandalizing the court. 2. Section 579 of the Criminal Code be found of no force in law. 3. Section 46 of the BC Constitution Act be found of no force in law. 4. The office of the Attorney General to be rebuked. 5. To Strike the Application by Regina for a summary judgement. 6. Joinder and amendment under rule 6 7. Costs at Scale C [32] I have reviewed the material to determine whether it raised evidence of a reasonable excuse for delay in prosecuting this litigation. It does not. It has not been accepted for filing. “B. M.

Lata, 2019 BCSC 26 Date: 20190109 Docket: E53511 Registry: New Westminster Between: Umesh Jeet Claimant And: Roshini Lata Respondent Before: The Honourable Mr. Justice G.C. Weatherill Oral Reasons for Judgment The Claimant appearing in person: U. Jeet Counsel for the Respondent: J. Tchezganova Place and Dates of Trial: New Westminster, B.C. January 7–8, 2019 Place and Date of Judgment: New Westminster, B.C. January 9, 2019 [1] After opening skirmishes at the commencement of the trial, the parties to this family dispute settled all of the issues between them except the respondent’s entitlement to spousal support. The trial proceeded on that issue. [2] The claimant and the respondent are currently 59 and 53 years of age respectively. They were married on November 10, 1981 in Fiji at the ages of 22 and 16 respectively. It was what is commonly referred to as an “arranged marriage”. They separated just short of 32 years later on October 22, 2013. [3] The claimant has a Grade 10 education. The respondent has a Grade 11 education. She emigrated with him from Fiji to Canada in 1982 shortly after they were married. They had their first child when the respondent was 17 and their second when she was 22. The two children of their relationship are now 35 and 30, are living independently, and are no longer children of the marriage as defined by the Divorce Act , R.S.C. 1985, c. 3 (2nd Supp.). [4] Until the children became self-sufficient, the respondent was their primary caregiver as was customary in the parties’ culture. The respondent also worked full-time at the Hyatt Regency Hotel in Vancouver (“Hyatt”), initially as a housekeeper from 1988 to 2003, and from 2003 to the present as a switchboard operator. As is also the parties’ custom, the respondent was the primary homemaker during their relationship. She prepared the family’s meals and did the household cleaning, albeit with occasional assistance from the claimant’s mother. The respondent also took care of the claimant’s mother when she was ill. [5] The claimant has been employed full-time during the daytime as a janitor by the Willingdon Church for the past 25 years. In addition to that employment, for the past ten years, he has also been employed during the evenings as a janitor by the Langley Golf Course. He is paid on a combined basis of an 80-hour-work week. [6] During the course of the parties’ relationship and in addition to his two full time jobs, the claimant started a cleaning business through a corporate entity called Leading Edge Maintenance Inc. (“Leading Edge”). The claimant was the sole shareholder of the company. It provided cleaning services by way of contracts with various clients, including the Surrey Memorial Hospital. The cleaning services provided by Leading Edge were performed by the claimant and the respondent, although others were occasionally employed to assist with the work. The claimant testified that most of Leading Edge’s contracts were lost as a result of the stress he was under after the parties separated. However, he continued to work in his full-time jobs at Willingdon Church and Langley Golf Course. [7] The respondent testified that, in 2006, she was offered an opportunity to become a housekeeping supervisor at Hyatt but that taking the job would have resulted in her becoming the supervisor of the claimant’s parents who also worked there. After discussing the opportunity with the claimant, she decided that it would be better for the family if she did not accept the job. [8] In 2014, after separating from the claimant, the respondent was offered the position of “manager on duty” at Hyatt. She turned down the job because she was suffering from high stress and anxiety as a result of the parties’ separation. [9] The respondent testified that, throughout the parties’ relationship, the claimant made the parties’ mortgage payments but she paid all other household expenses, including utilities, food, phones, and car payments. The parties owned and occupied a home in Surrey, British Columbia at the time of their separation (“matrimonial home”). The matrimonial home has a coach house as well as a basement suite that the parties rented to tenants for $800 per month and $700 per month respectively. [10] After separation, the claimant continued to occupy the matrimonial home. He testified that the rental income has been intermittent since their separation as a result of various legal issues he encountered with the Municipality of Surrey as well as repairs that were necessary to the rental suites. In addition to rental of the coach house and basement suite, the claimant has rented out an upstairs bedroom for $400 per month. [11] The claimant testified that all of the parties’ income, including the rental income, was pooled by them and used for living expenses. The respondent testified that much of the money was kept by the claimant and that she is unaware of how he used it. [12] Since leaving the matrimonial home in October 2013, the respondent has lived in furnished rental accommodation in White Rock, BC. Her rent is $800 per month. She testified that her standard of living has declined since the separation. She no longer has the “luxury” of living in her own home and cannot afford to do many of the things that she was able to do when she was living with the claimant, such as attending movies and regularly going to restaurants. [13] The respondent testified that, at the time of separation, she had personal debt of $5,000 but now she has debt of approximately $37,000 because she is unable to make ends meet. She conceded that some of her current debt was incurred for legal fees in respect of this proceeding but she did not say how much. [14] Since separation, the respondent has received only $1,600 from the claimant in spousal support, although he also made car payments on her behalf in the amount of $400 per month for the period from March 1, 2018 to August 1, 2018. Accordingly, she has received a total of $4,000 in spousal support from the claimant. [15] The parties’ respective Line 150 income since separation was as follows: Claimant Respondent 2014 $69,926 $41,079 2015 $73,530 $42,074 2016 $74,142 $47,129 2017 $74,994 $46,952 [16] On questioning by the Court, the claimant stated that he expected his Line 150 income for 2018 to be approximately the same as it was in 2017. [17] In addition to his employment income, the claimant disclosed the following income in his Form F8 Financial Statements sworn December 18, 2017 and December 10, 2018: Rental Income Cleaning Contracts Total 2017 $11,700 $4,000 $15,700 2018 $12,600 $12,300 $24,900 [18] During the period from May 19, 2017 to August 7, 2018, the claimant made payments to his Visa credit card totalling $59,127, which averages almost $4,000 per month. He could not explain where this money had come from. He did not produce his bank account records despite them having been requested by counsel for the respondent. [19] The claimant is under the care of a cardiologist and, for at least the past year, he has been advised by his family doctor not to work more than 40 hours per week due to various medical symptoms which include hypertension, obstructive sleep apnea and a cardiac condition. However, he had not heeded that advice and has continued to work at both of his jobs. [20] The claimant testified that, approximately three weeks ago, he suffered a lower back injury and has been unable to work since. He has filed a claim with the WorkSafeBC and has been told to take one month off work. [21] During his direct examination, the claimant provided the evidence necessary to establish his entitlement to a divorce. That evidence was unchallenged and his claim for a divorce is unopposed. [22] Accordingly, I am granting an order of divorce to be effective 31 days after the date of these reasons for judgment, subject only to an appeal of this divorce order being filed in the interim, in which case the divorce will be subject to the outcome of the appeal. [23] The sole issue for determination is whether the respondent is entitled to spousal support and, if so, in what amount. [24] Section 161 of the Family Law Act , S.B.C. 2011, c. 25 [ FLA ] provides as follows: 161. In determining entitlement to spousal support…the court must consider the following objectives: (a) to recognize any economic advantages or disadvantages to the spouses arising from the relationship between the spouses or the breakdown of that relationship; (b) to apportion between the spouses any financial consequences arising from the care of their child, beyond the duty to provide support for the child; (c) to relieve any economic hardship of the spouses arising from the breakdown of the relationship between the spouses; (d) as far as practicable, to promote the economic self-sufficiency of each spouse within a reasonable period of time. [25] Section 162 of the FLA provides that the amount and duration of spousal support, if any, must be determined on consideration of the conditions, means, needs and other circumstances of each spouse, including the length of time the spouses lived together and the functions performed by each spouse during the period they lived together. [26] Similar provisions are contained in ss. 15.2(4) and (6) of the Divorce Act. [27] The respondent seeks both retroactive and ongoing spousal support on a compensatory (economic disadvantage) and non-compensatory (needs) basis. Compensatory support relates primarily to the first two objectives of spousal support referred to in s. 161 of the FLA , while non-compensatory support primarily relates to the third and fourth objectives. [28] The respondent has failed to demonstrate that she suffered an economic disadvantage arising from the parties’ relationship or the breakdown of that relationship. The Court was left to speculate that her decision to turn down the housekeeping supervisor and manager on duty positions would have resulted in an economic advantage to her. No evidence was presented regarding her management qualifications or aptitude for either position, the hours she would have had to work, the pay she would have received, or the likelihood that she would have succeeded in the position. More was needed to be shown than merely that the positions were offered to her. [29] Moreover, the evidence is that both parties contributed financially to their relationship throughout their marriage. They both made sacrifices—the claimant in the form of working additional jobs and the respondent in the form of child care, household chores, and assisting the claimant in his cleaning jobs. No attempt was made by the respondent to show that she contributed a greater amount than did the claimant. No attempt was made by the respondent to show that she was economically disadvantaged by being the primary caregiver to the children. Indeed, the evidence is to the contrary. She continued to work full-time in her career at Hyatt. [30] In summary, the evidence is insufficient to support the respondent’s claim for compensatory spousal support. [31] In Chutter v. Chutter , 2008 BCCA 507, the Court of Appeal described non‑compensable spousal support in the following terms at paras. 54 and 55: [54] Where compensatory principles do not apply, need alone may be sufficient to ground a claim for spousal support… Non-compensatory support is grounded in the “social obligation model” of marriage, in which marriage is seen as an interdependent union. It embraces the idea that upon dissolution of a marriage, the primary burden of meeting the needs of the disadvantaged spouse falls on his or her former partner, rather than the state… Non-compensatory support aims to narrow the gap between the needs and means of the spouses upon marital breakdown, and as such, it is often referred to as the “means and needs” approach to spousal support. … [55] The concept of “needs” in the context of non-compensatory spousal support goes beyond basic necessities of life and varies according to the circumstances of the parties. As stated by Finch J.A. (as he then was) in Myers v. Myers (1995), 17 R.F.L. (4 th ) 298, 65 B.C.A.C. 226, at para. 10: “Need” or “needs” are not absolute quantities. They may vary according to the circumstances of the parties and the family unit as a whole. “Need” does not end when the spouse seeking support achieves a subsistence level of income or any level of income above subsistence. “Needs” is a flexible concept and is one of several considerations which a trial judge must take into account in deciding whether any order for spousal support is warranted. [32] In V.B v. M.B. , 2017 BCSC 1761, this Court stated at paras. 240 to 242: [240] The goal of needs-based spousal support is to narrow the gap between the needs and means of former spouses. As explained in Chutter v. Chutter , 2008 BCCA 507, in longer marriages, the courts have measured need against the marital standard of living by looking at the difference between the spouses’ post-separation standard of living: see paras. 58-59. See also Hodgkinson v. Hodgkinson , 2006 BCCA 158 at paras. 68-69. [241] In Lee v. Lee , 2014 BCCA 383, the Court of Appeal upheld a trial judge’s dismissal of a husband’s claim for non-compensatory spousal support based on the disparity in the parties’ post-separation incomes. In that case, the husband claimed an income of less than $20,000 compared to his wife’s income of $120,000. [242] In her majority reasons, Justice Newbury carefully examined the cases dealing with non-compensatory support. At para. 65, Justice Newbury wrote: … To rule as a matter of law that Mr. Lee should be compensated indefinitely for the “loss” of the ability to share in Ms. Lee’s income and lifestyle would, taken to its logical conclusion, mean that support must be ordered on one model or the other in virtually every case that comes before the court. The concept of need (in the true sense) of the applicant spouse would be supplanted by the sole criterion of the respondent spouse’s ability to pay. Marriage would , contrary to what was said in Moge , automatically entitle a spouse to the standard of living enjoyed during the marriage, or as much as the payor could afford. I respectfully agree with Professor Rogerson’s suggestion, and with the Court in Griffiths, supra , that this cannot be correct. A ‘clean break’ is clearly possible in this case, and again as stated in Moge , the mere fact of marriage or its breakdown does not activate a “general tool of redistribution.” As far as I am aware, this principle has not been overruled. [33] It is clear from the foregoing case law that mere disparity of post-separation income is insufficient to establish a right to non-compensatory spousal support. [34] This was a long-term marriage of 32 years. The standard of living the parties enjoyed during their relationship was a result of their combined incomes. While together, they worked in their separate jobs as well as together in the cleaning business. They were able to live within their means. [35] However, after separation, while the claimant has continued to support his pre-separation lifestyle, the respondent has been unable to. I am satisfied on the evidence that she is barely eking out a living despite her minimal expenses and that she struggles to make ends meet. [36] Having considered these cases and the parties’ post-separation lifestyles, I have concluded that this is an appropriate case to award the respondent non-compensatory spousal support based upon need and to relieve the economic hardship arising from the breakdown of the marriage. I have also concluded that a lump sum award is appropriate in this case. It will allow the parties to make a clean break from each other and will promote the economic self-sufficiency of both of them. [37] In my view, given the length of the parties’ marriage, the functions that each party performed during their marriage and the agreement that the claimant will purchase the respondent’s equity interest in the matrimonial home for $240,000, the respondent’s needs will be met by an award at the low end of the scale under the Spousal Support Advisory Guidelines . I have taken into account the parties’ respective incomes since separation, including the undeclared rental and cleaning contract income of the claimant. I have also taken into account the $4,000 the respondent has already received in spousal support. I have considered, as well, the claimant’s health issues and that he will unlikely be able to maintain the feverish work pace that he has engaged in over the previous years. [38] Pursuant to s. 170(c) of the FLA and s. 15.2(1) of the Divorce Act , I am ordering that the claimant pay to the respondent a lump sum amount of $40,000 in respect of retroactive and prospective spousal support. [39] Given that most of the issues raised by the parties were settled at the opening of the trial and that the amount awarded for the final issue, spousal support, is substantially less than what was sought by respondent’s counsel during her submissions, it is my view that an award of costs is not appropriate in this case. “G.C.

OF APPEAL FOR BRITISH COLUMBIA Citation: Kaban Resources Inc. v. Goldcorp Inc., 2021 BCCA 6 Date: 20210108 Docket: CA47032 Between: Kaban Resources Inc. Appellant (Plaintiff) And Goldcorp Inc., Goldcorp Holdings (Barbados) Ltd., and Guatemala Holdings (Barbados) Limited Respondent (Defendants) Before: The Honourable Mr. Justice Grauer (In Chambers) On appeal from: An order of the Supreme Court of British Columbia, dated September 4, 2020 ( Kaban Resources Inc. v. Goldcorp Inc. , 2020 BCSC 1307, Vancouver Docket S165822). Counsel for the Appellant (via videoconference): R.D. Gibbens, Q.C. Counsel for the Respondents (via videoconference): A. Cocks Place and Date of Hearing: Vancouver, British Columbia December 21, 2020 Place and Date of Judgment: Vancouver, British Columbia January 8, 2021 Summary: The respondents apply for security for costs of the appeal and the proceedings below in the respective amounts of $16,017.95 and $163,851.14. The respondents seek an order that the appeal be stayed pending the posting of security for costs and that the respondents be at liberty to apply to have the appeal dismissed as abandoned should the appellants fail to post security. Trial costs is this matter have not yet been assessed. Held: the applications for security for costs of the appeal and trial are allowed, but not in the amount sought by the respondents. Security for costs of the appeal are ordered in the amount of $11,200. The appellant led no evidence that would demonstrate that an order for security for costs would prevent it from pursuing this appeal, and failed to meet its onus of demonstrating that it would not be in the interests of justice to order security for costs of the appeal. Security for costs of the trial are also ordered, but in the amount of $60,000. The manner in which the appellant pursued its claim in the proceedings below caused the respondent to obtain and deliver a costly expert report on the question of damages. Now, the parties cannot proceed to assess trial costs without waiving privilege over the expert report, practically preventing the respondents from pursuing its remedies from trial. As such, the respondents have established real prejudice and met the onus of demonstrating that it is in the interests of justice to order partial security for costs of the trial. The appeal is stayed for 30 days to permit the appellants time to post the security. In the event the appellants fail to post the security ordered, the respondents are at liberty to apply to have the appeal dismissed as abandoned. Reasons for Judgment of the Honourable Mr. Justice Grauer: [1] The appellant, Kaban Resources Inc, has brought this appeal from the judgment of Mr. Justice Voith, then of the Supreme Court, dismissing its claim after a summary trial. Justice Voith’s reasons for judgment are indexed at 2020 BCSC 1307. [2] The respondents, whom I shall describe collectively as “Goldcorp”, now apply under sections 24(1) and 10(2)(a) and (b) of the Court of Appeal Act , RSBC 1996, c 77, for an order requiring the appellant to post security both for the costs of the appeal, and for their costs of the proceedings below. Goldcorp seeks security in the amount of $16,017.95 for a one-day appeal, and in the amount of $163,851.14 for its trial costs (in excess of existing security), and asks that the appeal be stayed pending deposit of the amounts sought. Goldcorp also seeks the costs of this application payable forthwith. [3] The appellant’s claim against Goldcorp was for damages for the wrongful repudiation of a contract between the parties. To summarize matters very briefly, the parties had signed a letter agreement on February 3, 2016, providing for the transfer of mining assets of Goldcorp in Guatemala on various terms and conditions. On March 14, 2016, the appellant delivered an agreement to Goldcorp that purported to comply with the terms and conditions of the letter agreement, but involved a new party, Fortuna Silver Mines Inc., not mentioned in the letter agreement. Goldcorp had something to say about this, responding by letter on March 17, 2016. On March 21, 2016, Kaban sent an email to Goldcorp asserting that the March 17 letter constituted a repudiation of the February 3 letter agreement, and advising that Kaban accepted the repudiation, and considered the letter agreement to be at an end. [4] As I will discuss in more detail below, at a relatively early stage in the Supreme Court proceedings, the appellant was ordered to post security for costs in the amount of $60,000. It did so. The matter was later set for trial by jury, and ultimately came before Justice Voith on Goldcorp’s summary trial application. [5] As Justice Voith noted at para 5, the application raised four issues: i. Is this application suitable for disposition under Rule 9-7? ii. Did the Letter Agreement contain various implied terms? iii. Was there any obligation on Goldcorp to consent to the Fortuna Agreement? and iv. Did the March 17 Letter constitute a repudiation of the Letter Agreement? [6] The parties were agreed as to the first issue: the application was suitable for disposition by way of summary trial. As to the rest, Justice Voith noted at para 6 that each issue was independent. Goldcorp would succeed if the answer to question (ii) were ‘yes’, or if the answer to either of questions (iii) or (iv) were ‘no’. The judge concluded that the answer to (ii) was ‘yes’, the answer to (iii) was ‘no’, and it was unnecessary to answer question (iv). [7] Accordingly, the judge dismissed the appellant’s claim with costs. Goldcorp subsequently applied for double costs under Rule 9-1(5)(b) of the Supreme Court Civil Rules . That application was dismissed in reasons delivered December 15, 2020, and indexed as 2020 BCSC 1982. [8] I turn next to consider Goldcorp’s application for security for the costs of this appeal. I will then consider its application for security for its trial costs. [9] The relevant considerations have been discussed in many cases. I will quote from one, the reasons of Madam Justice D. Smith (in Chambers) in Arbutus Bay Estates Ltd v Canada (Attorney General) , 2017 BCCA 133: [17] The appellant against whom security is sought bears the onus of showing why security should not be required: Creative Salmon Company Ltd. v. Staniford , 2007 BCCA 285 at para. 9. The ultimate question is whether the order would be in the interests of justice: Lu v. Mao , 2006 BCCA 560 at para. 6. The following relevant considerations were set out in Lu at para. 6: (a) the appellant’s financial means; (b) the merits of the appeal; (c) the timeliness of the application; and (d) whether the costs will be readily recoverable. [18] The appellant’s financial position is the principal basis on which an order for some, all, or none of the security for appeal costs is made. See Zen v. M.R.S. Trust Company (1997), 88 B.C.A.C. 198 at para. 18. It is a discretionary order. Courts have also distinguished between corporate and individual plaintiffs, generally treating corporate plaintiffs with less flexibility. [10] As Justice Smith observed, the onus is on the appellant to establish that the interests of justice require that security not be ordered. [11] There is no doubt that Goldcorp has brought this application in a timely manner. Accordingly, the question really comes down to the appellant’s financial position and the merits of its appeal. These need to be balanced in order to ensure that the interests of justice are not frustrated by an order for security of costs inhibiting a meritorious appeal. [12] In this case, it is relevant to note that the appellant is a shell company with no active business. If it has any exigible assets, or other means of securing costs, it has declined to adduce any evidence of such, though repeatedly invited to do so by Goldcorp in order to avoid this application. It has been able to raise funds, including $60,000 to post in the court below to secure Goldcorp’s costs there, but that is quite a different thing from having the ability to satisfy a judgment of costs against it. No one connected with the appellant has come forward to undertake to cover costs. [13] In essence, the appellant rests its opposition to the application on what it maintains is a meritorious appeal. It has not, however, led evidence to indicate that if it is obliged to post security for the costs of the appeal, it will be unable to proceed. [14] I am satisfied that the appellant should be ordered to post security for Goldcorp’s costs of this appeal. The appellant has failed to meet the onus upon it of demonstrating that it would not be in the interests of justice to make the order. [15] With respect to the merits of the appeal, I would not suggest that the appeal is bound to fail. Nevertheless, the grounds it raises attract, prima facie , a deferential standard. Though they are framed as errors of law, they raise questions of contractual interpretation. But even if properly described as errors of law, the appellant is obliged to charge uphill given the trial judge’s findings. An additional ground of appeal, alleging that the judge created “a reasonable apprehension of bias through … engaging in ad hoc judicial moralism” also faces the significant hurdle of a heavy burden, given the presumptions of impartiality and judicial integrity. [16] The question then becomes, how much should the appellant be obliged to post as security for Goldcorp’s costs of the one-day appeal? Goldcorp’s draft bill of costs seeks the maximum for the items relating to the preparation of the factum and preparation for the hearing of the appeal. Given the nature of the appeal, I consider that unlikely to be achieved on an assessment. Its expected disbursements include the sum of $2,850 for transcripts, which will be disputed in the context of a summary trial, where the evidence was all in affidavits. In the circumstances, I would consider $8,000 for costs and applicable taxes, and $3,200 for disbursements and taxes, to be a fair estimate for present purposes. Accordingly, I order the appellant to post $11,200 to secure Goldcorp’s costs of this appeal. [17] As Justice Smith observed in the Arbutus Bay Estates case at para 16, the principles relating to an application for security for the costs of trial differ from those relating to security for the costs of the appeal. Most importantly, the onus flips from the appellant to the respondent. In para 19, Justice Smith said this: [19] The principles governing the exercise of discretion in awarding security for trial costs are set out in Fat Mel’s Restaurant Ltd. v. Canadian Northern Shield Insurance Company (1993), 76 B.C.L.R. (2d) 231 (C.A.); and Kropp v. Swanaset Bay Golf Course Ltd. (1997), 29 B.C.L.R. (3d) 252 (C.A). They include: (a) The onus is on the applicant to show that it is in the interest of justice to order posting for security of trial costs; (b) The applicant must show prejudice if the order is not made; and (c) In determining the interests of justice the chambers judge should consider the merits of the appeal and the effect of such an order on the ability of the appellant to continue the appeal. See Bronson v. Hewitt, 2012 BCCA 268 at para. 13. [18] A relevant consideration is the fact that, generally, in relation to collecting its trial costs, the respondent will be in no worse a position by reason of the appeal than it was before the appeal. It follows that an important question is whether the appellant’s pursuit of the appeal negatively alters Goldcorp’s ability to recover sums found by the trial court to be owing to it (for instance, by the appellant obtaining a stay pending appeal): see, for instance, D Bacon Holdings Ltd v Naramata Vines Inc , 2010 BCCA 427 at paras 25–26; Agent E v Canada (Attorney General) , 2018 BCCA 492 at para 17; and EB v British Columbia (Child, Family and Community Services) , 2020 BCCA 263 at para 29. [19] The appellant contends that Goldcorp has demonstrated no such negative effect here, and indeed already has the benefit of security for its trial costs in the amount of $60,000. Moreover, the appellant points out, Goldcorp has yet to have its trial costs assessed, a step that is usually expected unless the interests of justice dictate otherwise: Arbutus Bay Estates at para 20. [20] Goldcorp maintains that it has demonstrated a negative effect, and real prejudice. I agree. The question is whether it is sufficient to support the amount of security it requests. [21] Goldcorp points to the manner in which the appellant pursued its claim below. Initially, it indicated that it would pursue matters in an economical manner. When Goldcorp raised the prospect of an application for security for costs, the appellant sought to sever the questions of liability and quantum. It was in this context that it was ordered to pay security in the amount of $60,000. [22] But, as Goldcorp notes, that is not what happened. Instead, the appellant set the matter down for a six-week jury trial on both liability and quantum, set for the fall of 2020. Although Goldcorp set its summary trial application down for hearing in August 2020, it was obliged, it asserts, to obtain and deliver a lengthy expert report on the question of damages, given the pending jury trial. [23] The expense related to this expert report comes to a total of just over $168,000. This cost was not in contemplation at the time Goldcorp applied for security for its trial costs, because the trial was then expected to be on liability alone. [24] Now, because of this appeal, Goldcorp is not in a position to disclose its expert file for the purposes of supporting this expense, because to do so would waive privilege when the appellant seeks to have the case returned to the Supreme Court for a trial on damages—the subject of the expert report. [25] In these circumstances, I agree that prejudice arises. Because of the appellant’s change in tactics (which I do not criticize, but which has consequences), Goldcorp has incurred a hefty expense that was not anticipated when it first sought to secure its costs. Now, because of the appeal, it cannot proceed to assess those costs without waiving privilege. The practical effect is much like a stay, since the respondent is practically prevented from pursuing its remedies in the trial court, all in the context of an appellant who appears to be costs-proof (compare Chung v Shin , 2017 BCCA 355 at paras 33–35). [26] But the fact remains that the appropriateness of the expert witness fee, and the reasonableness of incurring it at the time it was incurred, are in issue. It is by far the largest component of Goldcorp’s unassessed bill of costs for the proceeding below. [27] It is, of course, open to me to order full security as requested, partial security or no security at all. Given all of the factors I have discussed, I consider that it is in the interests of justice to require the appellant to post an additional amount to secure Goldcorp’s trial costs—but not the full amount requested by Goldcorp, particularly without an assessment. I conclude that requiring the appellant to post the further sum of $60,000 would be appropriate. [28] Within 30 days, the appellant shall post the sum of $11,200 as security for Goldcorp’s costs of this appeal. [29] Within 30 days, the appellant shall post the sum of $60,000 as further security for Goldcorp’s costs of the proceedings in the Supreme Court. [30] The appeal is stayed pending the posting of security as ordered. [31] Goldcorp will be at liberty to apply to have the appeal dismissed as abandoned in the event the appellant fails to comply with this order. [32] Goldcorp seeks the costs of this application payable forthwith, in any event of the cause. In the circumstances, given that the appeal may continue, I award Goldcorp the costs of this application in the cause. I note, moreover, that Goldcorp’s draft bill of costs already includes the costs of preparation for and attendance at this application. In the circumstances, an order requiring the appellant to pay Goldcorp the costs of this application forthwith in any event of the cause, as Goldcorp requests, would be equivalent to requiring the appellant to pay the application costs twice: once forthwith, and a second time when posting the security that has now been ordered. “The Honourable Mr. Justice Grauer”"},"meta":{},"created_at":"2022-03-10T01:19:20.468514Z","updated_at":"2022-03-10T01:19:20.468521Z","project":3},{"id":72,"annotations":[{"id":78,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"start":3,"end":40,"text":"THE SUPREME COURT OF BRITISH COLUMBIA","labels":["COURT_NAME"]},"id":"TtxYoAJWfG","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":51,"end":86,"text":"Nieweler Estate (Re), 2019 BCSC 401","labels":["CITATION"]},"id":"tXeOqHIiuI","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":210,"end":242,"text":"The Honourable Mr. Justice Myers","labels":["PERS_JUDGE"]},"id":"FIW6iDAYT-","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":295,"end":310,"text":"Edward Nieweler","labels":["PERS_APPELLANT"]},"id":"r8J_1sglEe","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":312,"end":328,"text":"Claire Armstrong","labels":["PERS_COUNS_APPEL"]},"id":"xblxFcJnwg","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":355,"end":371,"text":"Stephan Nieweler","labels":["PERS_APPELLANT"]},"id":"ZOq3yhoiVk","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":416,"end":427,"text":"Ingrid Reid","labels":["PERS_APPELLANT"]},"id":"hG13UfGpCr","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":373,"end":389,"text":"John W.

THE SUPREME COURT OF BRITISH COLUMBIA Citation: Nieweler Estate (Re), 2019 BCSC 401 Date: 20190115 Docket: P181879 Registry: Vancouver In the Matter of the Estate of Hermann Josef Nieweler, Deceased Before: The Honourable Mr. Justice Myers Oral Reasons for Judgment Counsel for the applicant Edward Nieweler: Claire Armstrong Counsel for the applicant Stephan Nieweler: John W. Bilawich Counsel for the applicant Ingrid Reid: Jeffrey Locke Place and Date of Hearing: Vancouver, B.C. January 15, 2019 Place and Date of Judgment: Vancouver, B.C. January 16, 2019 [1] The deceased, Mr. Nieweler, died on June 10, 2015 leaving a will naming his three children, Ingrid, Edward and Stephan as co-executors. I will continue to refer to them by their first names. [2] Stephan and Edward apply to remove Ingrid as executor. After being served with Stephan's application, Ingrid applied to remove Stephan. [3] Stephan's Notice of Application fairly sets out the background facts and what follows is largely drawn from it. [4] Mr. Nieweler left a will dated January 24, 2013 (the \"Will\") naming Ingrid, Edward and Stephan as co-executors \/ co-trustees of his estate. The Will does not contain a \"majority\" clause, so the three co-executors are obliged to act unanimously in the discharge of their duties and obligations. [ 5 ] The Will provides that the residue of the deceased's estate is to be divided into three equal shares and that one such share goes to each of Ingrid, Edward and Stephan. [ 6 ] On December 23, 2015, the Court granted probate of the Will appointing Ingrid, Edward and Stephan as co-executors. [7] When Mr. Nieweler died, his estate included: · His residence at 486 Montroyal Place, North Vancouver. (This has since been sold.) · 12,500 out of the 50,002 common voting shares in Bastion Inn Ltd. and the only preferred share of Bastion. · 100 out of the 110 common voting shares in Montroyal Enterprises Ltd. (\"Montroyal\"). (Ingrid, Edward and Stephan held, respectively, four, three and three shares personally.) · All of the 100 common voting shares in Hermann's Jazz Club Inc. (the \"Pub\"). On March 30, 2016, these shares were transferred equally (33-1\/3 shares each) to Ingrid, Edward and Stephan; · All of the 360 common voting shares in Hermann's Jazz Inc. (the \"Jazz Club\"). On March 30, 2016 these were transferred equally to Ingrid, Edward and Stephan. [8] Montroyal holds 37,502 of the 50,002 common voting shares of Bastion Inn. [9] After Ingrid, Edward and Stephan became co-executors, the estate's lawyer, Mr. Lenaghan, arranged to have the deceased's shares in all four companies transferred to them as co-executors and to have all three appointed directors and officers of each of the four companies. [10] Bastion Inn owns a commercial property at 751\/753 View Street, Victoria, BC (the \"View Street Property\"). The 2011 appraised value per a marketing proposal was $3.55 million. [11] The View Street Property has two stories and a third-floor mezzanine. When Mr. Nieweler died, the second floor and third-floor mezzanine were leased to 1972 Productions Inc. o\/a \"Touch Lounge\". The ground floor was occupied by the Pub and Jazz Club. [12] After Mr. Nieweler's death, Ingrid and her husband Fraser Reid, an accountant, unilaterally carried out a financial reorganization of the Pub and Jazz Club. As a result, the original \"Hermann's Jazz Club\" business is currently owned and operated by the newer of the two operating companies (incorporated in 2014) and the newer pub business is shown as being owned and operated by the older company (incorporated in 2004). They did not seek Stephan's input or consent before doing so. [13] The Pub is an 80-seat operation. The Jazz Club is a 150-seat operation. They share a common kitchen. Neither has a formal written lease with Bastion Inn. [14] Bastion Inn holds three liquor licences for the View Street Property. [15] The original Hermann's Jazz Club business was Mr. Nieweler's passion, shared by Stephan. Prior to Mr. Nieweler's death, Stephan was actively involved in all aspects of the operation and management of the business and involved in the creation of the new pub business. Neither Ingrid nor Edward were particularly involved while the deceased was alive. [16] Within days following Mr. Nieweler's death, Ingrid and Mr. Reid took possession of financial records for all four companies and relocated them to their home in Surrey, despite objections. Stephan wanted accounting functions to continue to be handled by the bookkeepers and accountants the deceased had been dealing with. [17] I will not detail the machinations but as things currently stand, the estate still owns shares in Bastion Inn and Montroyal. The shares formerly owned in the Pub and Jazz Club were transferred to Ingrid, Edward and Stephan in their personal capacities. The View Street Property is the largest remaining asset in the deceased's estate. [ 18 ] The beneficiaries started to disagree with respect to the handling of the estate shortly after their father died. [19] Stephan commenced two petitions seeking to address his exclusion from having a management role in the two estate-controlled companies, Bastion Inn and Montroyal and claiming an oppression remedy relating to the Pub and Jazz Club. [20] On March 6, 2017, before the Petitions had been scheduled for hearing on their merits, Ingrid and Mr. Reid requested a delay because of the death of their son. Stephan agreed and both Petitions were put on hold. [21] In late March 2017, Stephan and Edward began exploring ways to reach a consensus and begin working cooperatively. This eventually led to Edward and Stephan reaching an agreement to settle the dispute, which was then presented to and accepted by Ingrid (in June 2017). [22] The applicants rely on: · Sections 158 and 159 of the Wills, Estates and Succession Act , S.B.C. 2009, c. 13; · Section 30 of the Trustee Act , R.S.B.C. 1996, c. 464; · The inherent jurisdiction of the court. [23] The parties are agreed on the law relating to the removal of a trustee. [24] Section 158(2) of WESA provides: 158(2) A person having an interest in an estate may apply to the court to remove or pass over a person otherwise entitled to be or to become a personal representative. [25] Section 159 (1) of WESA provides 159(1) If the court discharges or removes a personal representative, the court (a) must appoint another person who consents to act as the substitute personal representative, unless (i) the administration of the estate is complete, or (ii) the court does not consider a new appointment necessary, and ... [26] Finally, s. 30 of the Trustee Act provides: A trustee or receiver appointed by any court may be removed and a trustee, trustees or receiver substituted in place of him or her, at any time on application to the court by any trust beneficiary who is not under legal disability, with the consent and approval of a majority in interest and number of the trust beneficiaries who are also not under legal disability. [27] A testator is entitled to appoint the executor(s) he chooses and that discretion will not be lightly interfered with: DeCotiis v. DeCotiis , 2008 BCSC 1206. [28] The Will does not contain a majority clause, which means that the co-executors are obliged to act unanimously: Clock Holdings Ltd. v. Braich Estate , 2008 BCSC 1697 at para. 16. [ 29 ] Animosity between the executor and a beneficiary alone is not on its own sufficient to warrant removal of an executor: Letterstedt v. Broers (1884), 9 A.C. 371 at 389 (P.C.); see also 385–6. However, animosity between co-executors can be relevant to whether it is reasonable to expect they can work effectively and efficiently together to carry out their duties. Thus, in Levi-Bandel v. McKeen , 2011 BCSC 247, Mr. Justice Butler removed a co-executrix to address paralysis arising from difficulties between co-executors: [21 ] However, it is not only an act of misconduct that can be grounds for removal of a trustee. A failure to act can amount to grounds for removal. In Scott v. Scott , [1991] 5 W.W.R. 185 (Sask. Q.B.), Baynton, J. relied on the inherent jurisdiction of the Saskatchewan Court of Queen's Bench to remove a trustee where the actions of one trustee in refusing to sign cheques or provide an accounting produced a stalemate amongst the trustees. His refusal was motivated by his wish to be compensated by the trust for caring for one of the principals of the trust. He refused to sign cheques or provide the accounting until he was paid. The court found that the trustee's deliberate failure to act placed him in breach of his fiduciary duties to the beneficiaries of the trust. [22 ] The actions of Ms. McKeen have some similarity to the actions of the trustee in Scott . The delays in responding to requests for information and the refusal to meet to discuss legitimate issues impeded the administration of the estate. The cause of the difficulties appears to have been Ms. McKeen's request for reimbursement of expenses, along with the difficulties regarding the Cat Bequest. [23 ] Matters were further complicated by her threatened claim against the estate for an alleged personal injury. I have little difficulty in concluding that her inaction and her intransigence caused unnecessary delay. Her refusal or reluctance to proceed with the administration of the estate amounts to a want of reasonable fidelity and a failure to carry out her duties. [24 ] The essence of the difficulty in this case is that the administration of the estate has been paralyzed by the tension between the two executrixes. This is extremely unfortunate given how little remains to be done in order to finalize and distribute the estate. [25 ] The only practical way to deal with the road block is to remove one of the executrixes. Ms. McKeen's suggestion that I should direct the executrixes to work matters out between themselves is not practical. They have been attempting, or at least Ms. Levi-Bandel has attempted, to do that for almost two years. It has not worked. Even the resignation of Ms. Guthrie and the appointment of counsel has not allowed the parties to get around the impasse. The only practical solution is to remove one of the executrixes, or appoint a new executor and trustee. The latter option does not make sense when the estate is so close to distribution. Given the support of the 12 residuary beneficiaries for the removal of Ms. McKeen, there is no reason to consider the alternative of a new trustee. [30] Other cases have applied a similar analysis. See Campbell v. Campbell , 2015 BCSC 744 at paras. 18–19; Re Winter Estate , 2001 NSSC 121 at para. 25; Conroy v. Stokes , [1952] 4 D.L.R. 124 (B.C.C.A.) and Re Seaton Estate , 2003 BCCA 555. [ 31 ] The main guide in exercising the Court's discretion to remove trustees is the welfare of the beneficiaries: Letterstedt at 387. It is not the interests of a particular beneficiary that are to be considered, but rather the benefit of the beneficiaries collectively: Conroy v. Stokes , at 128; Re Winter Estate , at para. 22. [ 32 ] An executor is obliged to settle the affairs of the estate and distribute to beneficiaries: Reznik v. Matty , 2013 BCSC 1346 para. 29 et seq . A power to retain an asset does not override the executor's duty to settle the affairs of the estate and to distribute. [ 33 ] Dirnberger Estate , 2016 BCSC 439, concerned an application to remove an executor who had failed to distribute a simple estate despite having had four years to do so. Kelleher J. found that unreasonable delay and failure to act can constitute grounds for removal. He noted: [11 ] There are four categories of conduct on an executor's part that will warrant removal: 1. endangerment of the trust property; 2. want of honesty; 3. want of proper capacity to execute the duties; and 4. want of reasonable fidelity. [ Conroy v. Stokes , [1952] 4 D.L.R. 124 (B.C.C.A.)] [34] Before addressing the conduct impugned by both Stephan and Ingrid, I will address a general point. Stephan relies on the conduct of Ingrid in relation to the privately held companies and the estate property. While it is true that her conduct in relation to the companies cannot be a direct reason to remove her as trustee under the Will, it is relevant to show her attitude to her siblings and her ability to carry out the duties as a trustee. Moreover, it is not possible to draw a bright line between the companies and the trust property because the companies operate businesses in the building owned by the estate. [35] There is a long list of complaints by Stephan about Ingrid's behaviour, but I will focus on the major ones that I think are determinative of this application. [36] First is Ingrid's conduct with respect to the sale and use of the View Street Property. She refused to agree to sell the property unless the other executors agreed to unreasonable conditions completely unrelated to the sale. [37] What is worse is that, acting on her behalf under a power of attorney, Mr. Reid sent several emails to the real estate agent in which he gratuitously disclosed the internal disputes between the executors and misrepresented that the other two siblings owed Ingrid money. This was nothing short than wanting to take the disputes to the brink at the risk of scuttling the prospective deal for the sale of the property. That came to fruition: the deal did not get finalised. [38] Second, although not in chronological order, Ingrid moved into the property and had the locks changed. She refused to provide keys to Edward or Stephan. She started to make modifications to the property with an apparent view to opening a new lounge. When Stephan went to visit the property on June 20, 2018 Ingrid's friend or business associate slammed the door in his face. [39] Third, there is Ingrid and Mr. Reid's conduct with respect to the mortgage and Island Savings Credit Union, which granted the mortgage. I will not detail the emails; it will suffice to state that they contained falsehoods and, once again, disclosed the internal disagreements between the parties for no good reason. What is worse is that several of the emails were an invitation to foreclose on the mortgage. Mr. Reid, an accountant, has no excuse to have sent the emails. [40] Although not in relation to the trust property, Ingrid withdrew substantial amounts of cash from the companies' bank accounts without authorisation or disclosure. [41] Mr. Reid's emails to counsel for Stephan and Edward have been rude, to the point of accusing them of lying. [42] Counsel for Ingrid says that she has not misconducted herself for the last several months, namely since the application has been filed and the application should not, therefore, be granted. I do not think that is an answer. There is every reason to think that she and her husband will resume their conduct when it suits them. [43] In my view, the matters I have set out here show all four of the types of conduct that justify removal of an executor, as set out above in the quote above from Dirnberger Estate . [44] What of the application to remove Stephan? The main (but not the only) conduct relied on in support of that was that when the listing for sale of the Montroyal home was being discussed, Stephan indicated he would not agree to its sale unless, as noted by the estate solicitor: The return of all accounting responsibilities for the estate and for the companies to a third party accounting firm (everyone has agreed on Warren Towler) and a cessation of Mr. Reid Reid's involvement in those accounting matters; The granting of a three year lease in the View Street building to Hermann's Jazz Club Inc. , which lease would include the following components… [45] I agree that Stephan's position was inappropriate. However, I also note that he resiled from that position and in fact the house was listed and sold. Unlike Ingrid and Mr. Reid's conduct, it did not put the property at risk. His conduct was nowhere near as serious as Ingrid's. Moreover, this was conduct that pre-dated the settlement agreement. Considering all of Ingrid's submissions, I do not think she has demonstrated a rationale to remove Stephan. [46] I therefore conclude that Ingrid is to be removed as executor and that Stephan and Edward are to remain as co-executors. I note that they are in agreement – as is Ingrid – that the View Street property is to be sold as soon as possible. [47] I direct that Stephan and Edward provide Ingrid with offers made on the property and their counter-offers to the same as soon as they are received. [48] Ingrid is to pass her account on a date to be agreed between counsel. [49] Stephan and Edward's special costs of this application are to be paid from the estate. \"E.M.

[2] The only witness in the trial was Constable Towns, who issued the traffic violation ticket to Mr. Chamberlain. His unchallenged evidence was that he estimated Mr. Chamberlain’s driving speed at 143 km\/h, and that his radar device gave a reading of 145 km\/h. Mr. Chamberlain was driving northbound on Highway 91 in Delta, BC, just south of the 64 th Avenue overpass, in an area where, it is the Crown’s position, a speed limit of 90 km\/h applies. [3] The main issue in the appeal is whether the evidence in the trial established beyond a reasonable doubt that a speed sign had been placed by the minister responsible for the administration of the Transportation Act. The Crown agrees that this is an essential element of the offence. [4] Mr. Chamberlain would also raise a new issue, which was not raised in the trial, of whether the evidence established beyond a reasonable doubt that any such sign, if one was in place, applied to his path of travel. [5] Speeding offences are addressed in s. 146 of the Motor Vehicle Act . Subsection (1) sets out “default” speed limits of 50 km\/h in a municipality or treaty lands, and 80 km\/h outside a municipality. Subsection (2) allows the minister responsible for the administration of the Transportation Act to erect or place a sign setting a higher or lower speed limit than those default limits. Subsection (3), which Mr. Chamberlain was charged with contravening, provides that it is an offence to drive at a higher rate of speed than indicated on a sign erected or placed by the minister. Those provisions read as follows: 146(1) Subject to this section, a person must not drive or operate a motor vehicle on a highway in a municipality or treaty lands at a greater rate of speed than 50 km\/h, and a person must not drive or operate a motor vehicle on a highway outside a municipality at a greater rate of speed than 80 km\/h. (2) The minister responsible for the administration of the Transportation Act may, by causing a sign to be erected or placed on a highway limiting the rate of speed of motor vehicles or a category of motor vehicles driven or operated on that portion of the highway, increase or decrease the rate of speed at which a person may drive or operate a motor vehicle or a category of motor vehicle on that portion of the highway. (3) If the minister responsible for the administration of the Transportation Act has caused a sign to be erected or placed on a highway limiting the rate of speed of motor vehicles or a category of motor vehicles driven or operated on that portion of the highway, a person must not, when the sign is in place on the highway, drive or operate a vehicle on that portion of the highway at a greater rate of speed than that indicated on the sign for that category of motor vehicle. [6] As I noted earlier, Mr. Chamberlain submits that the evidence did not establish beyond a reasonable doubt, for the purposes of s. 146(3), that a 90 km\/h sign had been erected or placed by the minister. [7] I should note that it was tacitly acknowledged that the minister may erect or place a sign through delegates or employees – there was no suggestion that the minister must do so personally. [8] The evidence Constable Towns gave about the speed signs he evidently thought to apply was as follows: As I proceeded to my enforcement location, I confirmed that the posted signage in the area read 90 kilometres an hour. Two lanes north, two lanes south. The signs were clear and posted and had not been removed since the previous shift . I was stationary, parked facing west in the unmarked police vehicle so I could target northbound traffic on the two lanes of Highway 91. The conditions this day were cloudy but wet. We were on an asphalt road surface and it was the daytime. This is Highway 91 northbound, just south of 64 th Avenue overpass in the City of Delta, British Columbia. As I was monitoring traffic for vehicles that I felt to be travelling above the posted speed limit of 90 kilometres an hour , a vehicle was fast approaching that I observed in lane one. I described the vehicle as a grey Sedan with LED-style daytime running lights. [emphasis added] [9] This evidence thus did not expressly address whether the speed signs to which Constable Towns referred had been placed by the minister. [10] The Crown submits that s. 201 of the Act applies to provide the evidence that Constable Towns did not expressly give. Section 201 reads as follows: 201 The existence of a sign permitted by this Act and purporting to regulate the use of the highway in any manner is evidence the sign was duly erected and maintained by the proper authority under this Act and in accordance with this Act and the regulations. [11] Where s. 201 applies, it relieves the Crown (absent evidence to the contrary) of having to prove that that the sign was duly erected and maintained by the proper authority under the Act , and that the sign accorded with the Act and the regulations. [12] In my view – and I did not take there to be disagreement on this – the minister is a “proper authority” under the Act , and s. 201, if it applies, will thus relieve the Crown of having to prove that a speed sign was erected or placed by the minister. [13] The parties disagree about whether the evidence in the trial was sufficient to engage s. 201. [14] Counsel agree that s. 201 is engaged only where there is evidence of a sign “permitted by this Act and purporting to regulate the use of the highway in any manner”. That portion of s. 201 involves two components: (1) that the sign was “permitted by this Act”; and (2) that the sign was “purporting to regulate the use of the highway”. [15] The second component is not in issue in this appeal. There is no suggestion that the sign on which Constable Towns relied in concluding that the speed limit was 90 km\/h was not a sign “purporting to regulate the use of the highway”. [16] The dispute between the parties relates to the first component, namely whether the speed sign was “permitted by this Act”. More specifically, the issue is whether Constable Towns gave evidence from which the judicial justice of the peace could reasonably have concluded that there was such a sign. [17] So I turn to address what “permitted by this Act” means. [18] Mr. Chamberlain submits that a sign “permitted by this Act” means a sign that complies with the Act and the regulations. The regulations include numerous mandatory requirements for the size, shape, and other features of speed signs. Mr. Chamberlain submits that s. 201 is not engaged unless there is some evidence that the sign in question met those requirements. [19] I cannot agree. Such an interpretation would effectively defeat the purpose of s. 201, because s. 201 would be engaged only where the Crown proves the very features of a sign that s. 201 is designed to relieve the Crown from proving. [20] I conclude that, in the present context, a sign “permitted by this Act” means a sign permitted by s. 146(2). As I noted earlier, s. 146(2) permits the minister to erect or place a speed sign that increases or decreases the default speed limit that would otherwise apply by virtue of s. 146(1). [21] The next question is this: for a sign to be “permitted by” s. 146(2), must there be evidence that the minister erected or placed the sign? After all, the language of s. 146(2) begins with, “The minister responsible for the administration of the Transportation Act may, by causing a sign to be erected or placed …”. One could read the provision as requiring evidence that it was the minister who erected or placed the sign, in order for the sign to be viewed as “permitted” for the purposes of s. 201. [22] However, in my view, such an interpretation would – like the interpretation put forward by Mr. Chamberlain that I discussed above – defeat the purpose of s. 201. In addition to relieving the Crown of the requirement to prove that the sign complied with the Act and the regulations, s. 201 relieves the Crown of the requirement to prove that the sign was “duly erected … by the proper authority”. This aspect of s. 201 is clearly intended to relieve the Crown of proving the minister’s involvement in the erecting or placing of the sign. [23] In my view, the evidence required to engage s. 201 is, simply, that there was a speed sign. On the basis of that evidence, s. 201 then provides that (absent evidence to the contrary) the sign was “duly erected … by the proper authority”, who, in this context, is the minister. Section 201 similarly provides that the sign accords with the requirements of the Act and the regulations. [24] Constable Towns’ evidence about the posted speed signs, taken in conjunction with s. 201, was therefore sufficient to establish that the sign was erected or placed by the minister. [25] But even if s. 201 was unavailable to the Crown, and the Crown was therefore obliged to prove that the signs were erected or placed by the minister, I cannot agree with Mr. Chamberlain that the evidence was insufficient. [26] It is true that Constable Towns made no express reference, in his evidence, to the minister (or any delegates or employees of the minister) having had any involvement in placing the sign. He also gave no description of the signs in a way that made clear that they met the detailed requirements of the regulations (so as to support an inference that it must have been the minister who erected them). [27] But in my view, the body of evidence as a whole allowed for the reasonable inference that the signs to which Constable Towns referred were signs placed by the minister. This was the inference that the judicial justice of the peace evidently drew: THE COURT: Well, at the risk of contradicting other courts, I do not agree with you, Mr. Chamberlain. Section [201] is the presumption section, that is, a presumption of regularity of the sign and the schedules which describe the sign is just simply – describe how they must – how they must look and I am satisfied that where the officer says that the posted speed – it was 90 kilometres in that – that is sufficient evidence in this case. MR. CHAMBERLAIN: But I think you’ve missed – the one provision says that the sign shall conform, which is mandatory. THE COURT: Yes. That is what it is saying. I mean, if there was some other weird sign up, I am sure the officer would have told us or somebody would have told us but, to the officer, that was a regular posted speed limit. That is the tenor of his evidence. I am sure if it was a tiny 90K or something, he would say what, and then he would have noticed that. So I think the tenor of his evidence is it is a regular posted 90 kilometre sign and that is the tenor of his evidence but I accept that. [emphasis added] [28] Constable Towns had given his evidence about the signs in the context of his role as a traffic enforcement officer with seven years of experience. His evidence had made clear that he was familiar with the speed signs in the area from at least one previous work shift. He had testified that he checked before beginning his speed enforcement duties on the day in question to make sure that the usual signs were in place. The judicial justice of the peace reasonably inferred that Constable Towns took the signs that he testified he saw as being ordinary or standard highway speed signs, namely signs erected or placed by the minister. [29] As I have explained, I do not consider it necessary for the Crown to have led evidence that the signs were erected or placed by the minister, because with evidence of a speed sign, s. 201 provided that evidence and nothing contradicted it. [30] However, even if evidence was necessary, I cannot conclude that the judicial justice of the peace was unreasonable or clearly wrong in his conclusion from the evidence that the signs to which Constable Towns referred were ordinary speed signs that had been erected or placed by the minister. [31] I turn, then, to whether the evidence established that the speed signs applied to the portion of the highway on which Mr. Chamberlain was driving. Mr. Chamberlain submits that it did not. [32] The Crown objects to this issue being raised because it was not raised in the trial. The Crown submits that Mr. Chamberlain has not met the test for raising a new issue outlined in R. v. Widdifield , 2016 BCCA 322 at para. 51. [33] It is unnecessary to determine whether the test in Widdifield is met because in my view Mr. Chamberlain cannot succeed on this issue, even if it is permitted to be raised. [34] My reasons are very similar to some of those I have given in relation to the first issue. [35] The judicial justice of the peace evidently concluded from the evidence as a whole that a 90 km\/h speed sign applied to Mr. Chamberlain’s path of travel. He had a basis in the evidence for this conclusion. Before and after referring to “[t]wo lanes north, two lanes south” on the highway, Constable Towns referred to “the posted signage in the area”, and to the “clear and posted” signs that had not been removed since the previous shift. In his enforcement duties that day, Constable Towns was targeting the two northbound lanes, “monitoring traffic for vehicles that [he] felt to be travelling above the posted speed limit”. He noticed Mr. Chamberlain’s vehicle fast approaching in one of the northbound lanes, and took steps to first estimate and then measure its speed. Constable Towns testified that from his laser equipment he obtained a reading of “145 kilometres an hour in a posted 90 kilometres an hour zone ” [emphasis added]. [36] In my view, the only reasonable conclusion from the evidence is that a sign limiting vehicles’ speed to 90 km\/h applied to Mr. Chamberlain’s path of travel. [37] The appeal is dismissed. “The Honourable Associate Chief Justice H.

Lange , 2019 YKCA 2 Date: 20190115 Docket: 15-YU771 Between: Regina Respondent And Mark Lewis Lange Appellant Before: The Honourable Chief Justice Bauman The Honourable Madam Justice Cooper The Honourable Mr. Justice Fitch On appeal from: An order of the Territorial Court of Yukon, dated November 27, 2015 ( R. v. Lange , 2015 YKTC 43, Whitehorse Docket No. 14-00138). Counsel for the Appellant: V. Larochelle Counsel for the Respondent: N. Sinclair Place and Date of Hearing: Whitehorse, Yukon May 11, 2018 Place and Date of Judgment: Vancouver, British Columbia January 15, 2019 Written Reasons by: The Honourable Madam Justice Cooper The Honourable Mr. Justice Fitch Concurred in by: The Honourable Chief Justice Bauman Summary: The appellant appeals his dangerous offender designation or, alternatively, the imposition of an indeterminate sentence. He says the sentencing judge erred by not providing any or sufficient reasons for the designation and by failing to consider his treatment prospects at the designation stage of the proceedings. The Crown concedes the latter issue, but argues that the dangerous offender designation was the only reasonable outcome. Held: the appeal is allowed. The sentencing judge erred in principle by failing to consider treatment prospects at the designation stage. On the evidence in this case and in the absence of clear factual findings respecting the appellant’s treatment prospects, the Court is unable to conclude that there is no reasonable possibility that a different result would have been reached absent the error. The matter is remitted for a new hearing. Reasons for Judgment of the Honourable Madam Justice Cooper and the Honourable Mr. Justice Fitch: [1] Mr. Mark Lange appeals his dangerous offender designation or, alternatively, the imposition of an indeterminate sentence. For the reasons that follow, we are of the view that the appeal must be allowed, the dangerous offender designation set aside, and the matter remitted for a new hearing. [2] In June of 2014, the appellant was charged with aggravated assault. He subsequently pleaded guilty to the included offence of assault causing bodily harm. The Crown brought an application to have him declared a dangerous offender pursuant to s. 753(1)(a)(i) and (ii) of the Criminal Code , R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46 [ Criminal Code ]. On November 27, 2015, the appellant was declared a dangerous offender and sentenced to an indeterminate sentence. The reasons for judgment are indexed as 2015 YKTC 43. [3] For the purposes of the dangerous offender proceeding, the sentencing judge had information regarding the appellant’s prior convictions, which consist of a mix of violent offences, property offences and offences for breaching court orders. To establish the requisite pattern, the Crown relied on the following convictions: · 1990 (Youth Court): Assault with a weapon (s. 267(1)(a) of the Criminal Code ) – 18 months’ probation; · 1998: Assault causing bodily harm (s. 267(1)(b) of the Criminal Code ) – 6 months’ imprisonment to be followed by 18 months’ probation; · 1998: Assault (s. 266 of the Criminal Code ) – 60 days’ imprisonment, consecutive to the sentence being served for assault causing bodily harm; · 2006: Manslaughter (s. 236 of the Criminal Code) – 9 years and 4 months’ imprisonment; and · 2014: Uttering threats (s. 264.1(1)(a) of the Criminal Code ) – 75 days’ imprisonment, to be followed by 9 months’ probation. [4] The sentencing judge was provided with numerous documents from prior court proceedings, affidavits and evidence from corrections representatives and, as the appellant is Indigenous, a Gladue report. The sentencing judge also had two psychiatric assessments prepared by forensic psychiatrist Dr. Shabehram Lohrasbe – one from 2012 and one prepared for the purposes of the 2015 proceedings. The 2015 assessment addressed the prospects of successful treatment of the appellant. [5] In his report, Dr. Lohrasbe stated that while it was possible that Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD), and brain injury were present, the risks associated with medicating for any of these diagnoses outweighed any benefits that might be achieved. [6] He determined that the appellant displayed anti-social attitudes, values, and behaviours but that he had responded well to programming in the past and that “[h]e can do better with appropriate guidance in the future.” [7] Alcohol was identified as a factor in the appellant’s criminality. He had periods of sobriety, including an extended period of seven years. A stronger commitment to sobriety would require “support and supervision, but again it is doable.” Dr. Lohrasbe concluded that, should certain preconditions be met, the appellant could be safely supervised in the community. [8] The sentencing judge reviewed the evidence. He outlined the nature and circumstances of the predicate offence and the prior offences. He discussed the background and personal circumstances of the appellant. He reviewed the treatment which the appellant had undergone over the years and made reference to some of the conclusions in the 2015 psychiatric assessment. The sentencing judge concluded: [47] Based on the analysis of the criminal record and the facts of the predicate offence, the psychiatric assessment report, the other reports and the viva voce testimony, the Court has no hesitation whatsoever in declaring Mr. Lange a dangerous offender under subsections 753(1)(a)(i) and 753(1)(a)(ii) of the Code . [9] Having found Mr. Lange to be a dangerous offender, the sentencing judge proceeded to consider whether there was a reasonable expectation that a sentence other than an indeterminate one would adequately protect the public. He decided that it would not. [10] The issues on this appeal are: 1. Did the sentencing judge err in not providing sufficient reasons? 2. Did the sentencing judge err in not considering prospects for treatment at the designation stage of the proceedings? 3. Did the sentencing judge err in failing to consider whether the predicate offence was part of a broader pattern of violent behaviour? 4. Is the indeterminate sentence demonstrably unfit? [11] The relevant provisions of the Criminal Code provide: Application for finding that an offender is a dangerous offender 753 (1) On application made under this Part after an assessment report is filed under subsection 752.1(2), the court shall find the offender to be a dangerous offender if it is satisfied (a) that the offence for which the offender has been convicted is a serious personal injury offence described in paragraph (a) of the definition of that expression in section 752 and the offender constitutes a threat to the life, safety or physical or mental well-being of other persons on the basis of evidence establishing (i) a pattern of repetitive behaviour by the offender, of which the offence for which he or she has been convicted forms a part, showing a failure to restrain his or her behaviour and a likelihood of causing death or injury to other persons, or inflicting severe psychological damage on other persons, through failure in the future to restrain his or her behaviour, (ii) a pattern of persistent aggressive behaviour by the offender, of which the offence for which he or she has been convicted forms a part, showing a substantial degree of indifference on the part of the offender respecting the reasonably foreseeable consequences to other persons of his or her behaviour, or (iii) any behaviour by the offender, associated with the offence for which he or she has been convicted, that is of such a brutal nature as to compel the conclusion that the offender’s behaviour in the future is unlikely to be inhibited by normal standards of behavioural restraint; or … Sentence for dangerous offender (4) If the court finds an offender to be a dangerous offender, it shall (a) impose a sentence of detention in a penitentiary for an indeterminate period; (b) impose a sentence for the offence for which the offender has been convicted — which must be a minimum punishment of imprisonment for a term of two years — and order that the offender be subject to long-term supervision for a period that does not exceed 10 years; or (c) impose a sentence for the offence for which the offender has been convicted. Sentence of indeterminate detention (4.1) The court shall impose a sentence of detention in a penitentiary for an indeterminate period unless it is satisfied by the evidence adduced during the hearing of the application that there is a reasonable expectation that a lesser measure under paragraph (4)(b) or (c) will adequately protect the public against the commission by the offender of murder or a serious personal injury offence. [12] The sentencing judge did not have the benefit of the Supreme Court of Canada’s decision in R. v. Boutilier , 2017 SCC 64, which confirmed that s. 753(1) of the Criminal Code – the designation stage of the dangerous offender proceedings – requires the court to consider an offender’s future treatment prospects. The failure to do so constitutes error in principle. [13] The Crown concedes that the sentencing judge erred by failing to consider treatment prospects at the designation stage. The Crown argues, however, that based on the evidence, the only reasonable result was the dangerous offender designation. The Crown urges the Court to dismiss the appeal. [14] Having found that the sentencing judge erred, the Court can dismiss the appeal if there is no reasonable possibility that the verdict would have been any different had the error of law not been made: R. v. Johnson , 2003 SCC 46 at para. 49. In this case, it is not possible for the Court to determine what the verdict would have been if the judge had not erred because he failed to give sufficient reasons for his decision. Thus, the second ground of appeal is inextricably connected with the first. [15] There was evidence before the sentencing judge regarding the appellant’s treatment prospects in the form of Dr. Lohrasbe’s assessment report. Dr. Lohrasbe’s conclusions on the subject of treatability were as follows: To summarize treatability: Mr. Lange has engaged with and benefited from programs in the past. While his relapse into substance abuse and his violence are of obvious concern, it does not follow that further treatment interventions are worthless. It is a lamentable fact that such relapses occur with some frequency (‘old habits die hard’). In my opinion, given his strengths but acknowledging the long road he has ahead of him, it is still reasonable to hypothesize that with further treatment interventions, and further growth on his part, his risk could be reduced to levels that can be managed in the community in the foreseeable future. Such interventions should not be focused on what he has (as much as such would be his preference), but on who he is , what he does , and the way he approaches and responds to what he encounters in the future. … …To safely supervise an offender such as Mr. Lange in the community, there has to be a strong alliance between him and his supervisors. Such an alliance is based on Mr. Lange moving toward openness, honesty, disclosiveness, and behavioural cooperation. If he continues to harbour hostility toward representatives ‘of the system’, and mistrusts the individuals charged with his monitoring and supervision in the community, risk management will be problematic… He is very cognisant of the fact that current sentencing proceedings mean that he has ‘run out of chances’, and that any further acts of significant violence may result in a lengthy incarceration. His ‘jailhouse fatigue’ and his knowledge that he will have no more chances may be strong motivators for treatment and for compliance with supervision. He is mindful that he had been given the opportunity to redeem himself and has failed. He is aware that time is running out for him to put his talents [as an artist] at the forefront of his identity. Such awareness is likely to assist in motivation for renewed efforts to examine and shift his attitudes. If he engages in the treatment programs that will be offered to him and learns that he benefits through cooperation and compliance, he may gradually come to see that ‘the system’ shares with him the goal of keeping him out of jails and prisons. It is then that the combination of aging, maturity, ‘burnout’, and close monitoring of his commitment to abstinence may be sufficient for safe risk management in the community. [Emphasis in original] [16] The assessment report concluded with a summary, which stated: At present and in the foreseeable future: A. Mr. Lange will pose a high risk for violence. B. Further engagement in therapeutic programs available within the penitentiary system are likely to be of assistance in reducing risk. The goal would be to get him to the point where managing his risk in the community can reasonably be envisioned. C. Before risk management in the community can be contemplated, Mr. Lange will need to have a track record of cooperation, honesty, and disclosure. D. To manage his risk in the community, his supervisors would need to have a high level of confidence that Mr. Lange is genuine and steadfast in his commitment to total abstinence from alcohol and all intoxicants. E. Such preconditions to safe management in the community, while challenging, are not outside the realm of reasonable possibility. F. When Mr. Lange is released into the community, the lengthier the period of parole, the greater the chances of preventing further violence, through a combination of monitoring, supervision, therapy, and victim safety planning. [17] Dr. Lohrasbe’s report was supplemented by his testimony given during the hearing. [18] In cross-examination of Dr. Lohrasbe, defence counsel highlighted factors that had the potential to positively impact the appellant’s prospects for successful treatment. These included the motivation for change provided by the court proceedings; further engagement in programming while incarcerated; the appellant’s intellectual curiosity and understanding that he is becoming institutionalized, which speak to his insight; the gains he made while previously incarcerated; his age; his acceptance of responsibility; and the benefits of a supportive transitional period upon release. [19] Dr. Lohrasbe’s cross-examination concluded with the following exchange: Q And so would it be your opinion that, if, given all of these positive features and assuming for argument[’s] sake, his acceptance of treatment and programming and engagement that is it your opinion that there would be a reasonable expectation he could be managed in the community? A Yes. [Emphasis added.] [20] Thus, Dr. Lohrasbe’s conclusion was that successful treatment was a “reasonable possibility”, or that there was a “reasonable expectation” of successful treatment, if the appellant committed himself to a treatment program; established a track record of cooperation, honesty, and disclosure; and was committed to total abstinence from alcohol and all intoxicants. Given this evidence, it was incumbent upon the sentencing judge to make factual findings regarding the appellant’s ability to achieve the preconditions and be successfully treated. Depending on how the sentencing judge assessed the evidence, a finding that the Crown had not discharged its onus for the appellant to be designated a dangerous offender was a reasonably possible outcome. [21] Regrettably, although the sentencing judge reviewed Dr. Lohrasbe’s evidence, he did not make findings of fact in relation to it. It is not possible to determine from the reasons for sentence what he considered to be the likelihood of the appellant achieving the pre-conditions to successful treatment, nor is it possible to determine, if those pre-conditions were met, what he considered to be the likelihood of successful treatment. [22] In this respect, the case at bar differs from R. v. Wesley , 2018 ONCA 636 at para. 17, and R. v. Malakpour , 2018 BCCA 254 at paras. 95–98. In each of these cases, the sentencing judge made findings of fact that the appellate court was able to assess in the context of the applicable law and determine that the result would not have been different had the sentencing judge properly considered treatability at the designation stage. We do not have the benefit of such findings. [23] The sentencing judge erred in principle by failing to consider treatment prospects at the designation stage. Given the evidence in this case, it cannot be said there is no reasonable possibility of a different result had the error not been made. In the absence of clear factual findings on this critical issue, it is our view that the Court is not in a position to affirm the dangerous offender finding nor is it in a position to substitute for the dangerous offender finding a finding that the appellant is a long-term offender. Unfortunately, a new hearing before a different judge is required and we would make that order under s. 759(3)(a)(ii) of the Criminal Code . [24] Given the findings on the first two grounds of appeal it is unnecessary to consider the remaining grounds. “The Honourable Madam Justice Cooper” “The Honourable Mr. Justice Fitch” I AGREE: “The Honourable Chief Justice Bauman”"},"meta":{},"created_at":"2022-03-10T01:19:20.468227Z","updated_at":"2022-03-10T01:19:20.468234Z","project":3},{"id":69,"annotations":[{"id":75,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"start":3,"end":40,"text":"THE SUPREME COURT OF BRITISH COLUMBIA","labels":["COURT_NAME"]},"id":"HuWzm1H51s","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":51,"end":100,"text":"Tietz v.

January 8, 2021 Table of Contents Background . 5 Issues . 5 History of the Litigation . 6 The Settlement Agreement . 7 Should the Action be Certified for the Purposes of Settlement? . 8 Should the Settlement Agreement be Approved? . 10 Conclusion . 12 [1] On December 14, 2020, I granted an application pursuant to the C lass Proceedings Act, R.S.B.C, c. 50 [ Act ], for certification of this action as a class proceeding against certain settling defendants, and for approval of the settlement of this action against the settling defendants in accordance with the terms of a settlement agreement, with reasons to follow. These are those reasons. [2] This action concerns the acquisition of shares in 2018 by certain defendants, referred to in the notice of civil claim as the “purported consultants”, under private placements carried out by certain other corporate issuer defendants, including one of the settling defendants, Beleave Inc. The other settling defendants, Andrew Wnek and Bojan Krasic, were both officers and directors of Beleave Inc. during the relevant time period. I will refer to Beleave Inc., Andrew Wnek, and Bojan Krasic collectively as the “Settling Defendants”. [3] This action arose out of an investigation by the British Columbia Securities Commission (the “Securities Commission”) into the private placements that are the subject of this action. [4] The plaintiffs allege that the defendants, including the Settling Defendants, participated in an investment scheme carried out in 2018. It is alleged the defendant purported consultants acquired shares in the defendant corporate issuers (including Beleave Inc.) through false pretenses and deception on the public market. This, they claim, resulted in loss and damage to the plaintiffs and other proposed class members who acquired shares in the defendant corporate issuers (including Beleave Inc.) after the deception. [5] The plaintiffs and the Settling Defendants entered into a settlement agreement dated July 31, 2020 (the “Settlement Agreement”). This is the first proposed settlement in this action which continues against the other defendants. [6] On December 14, 2020, the issues before me for determination were: a) Should the action be certified as a class proceeding for the purpose of and in accordance with the Settlement Agreement? If so, should Michael Tietz and Duane Loewen be appointed as representative plaintiffs? b) Should the Settlement Agreement be approved? [7] On November 26, 2018, the Executive Director of the Securities Commission issued a notice of hearing and temporary orders against many of the defendants in this action, including Beleave Inc. The orders included that these defendants cease trading in and were prohibited from purchasing securities of the defendant corporate issuers. [8] On January 15, 2019, the Securities Commission conducted a hearing with regard to extending the temporary orders until the investigation could be completed. The Securities Commission declined to extend the temporary orders against Beleave Inc. and some others. [9] On June 5, 2019, Beleave Inc. entered into a settlement agreement with the Securities Commission. In that settlement it agreed it had participated in conduct abusive to the capital markets and, but for mitigating circumstances, that conduct would otherwise warrant public interest orders against it. [10] This action was filed on July 11, 2019, and service of all defendants was completed in late December 2019. [11] Settlement discussions with plaintiffs’ counsel were initiated by counsel for Beleave Inc. These discussions were premised on the precarious financial condition of Beleave Inc., and the fact that the insurance proceeds, potentially available in respect of the claims, were being diminished by ongoing defence costs relating to the claims. [12] On February 21, 2020, the plaintiffs filed a petition seeking leave pursuant to s. 140.8 of the Securities Act, R.S.B.C. 1996, c. 418, to bring claims for secondary market liability under s. 140.3 of the Securities Act . [13] On June 5, 2020, Beleave Inc. filed for protection under the Companies’ Creditors Arrangement Act, R.S.C.1985, c. 36, in the Ontario Superior Court of Justice (the “CCAA Proceedings”). At that time the Court granted a stay of proceedings against Beleave Inc. and its officers and directors. [14] Counsel for the plaintiffs, counsel for the Settling Defendants, and counsel for Beleave Inc.’s insurer reached agreement on full terms of the Settlement Agreement in October 2020. [15] Due to the existing CCAA Proceedings and the related stay order, the Settlement Agreement contemplates that Beleave Inc. would first apply to the Ontario Court for an order authorizing it to enter into and execute the Settlement Agreement, an order lifting the stay order for the purposes of seeking approval of the Settlement Agreement, and an order granting certain declaratory to the insurer. [16] On November 16, 2020, the Ontario Court granted the orders sought. On November 30, 2020, the Ontario Court made an order terminating the CCAA Proceedings upon the filing of the monitor’s certificate, an order authorizing Beleave Inc. to file assignments into bankruptcy, and an order for the monitor to act as trustee in bankruptcy. A notice of termination of proceedings was issued by the monitor on December 3, 2020, giving notice that the monitor’s certificate terminating the CCAA Proceedings would be filed on December 15, 2020. [17] Under the terms of the Settlement Agreement the Settling Defendants agree to pay $2,400,000 for the benefit of class members. Upon court approval of the Settlement Agreement, the funds will be placed in a settlement fund held by counsel for the class members. [18] The Settling Defendants also agree to use reasonable efforts to cooperate with the plaintiffs in the continued prosecution of the action. These efforts include: a) The production of non-privileged documents relevant to the action. b) Mr. Wnek and Mr. Krasic will each: i. make themselves available for interviews with class counsel which will take place on a single day, will take no more than six hours, and may be transcribed by a court reporter; and ii. make themselves reasonably available to provide evidence at the trial of this action, or provide an affidavit or declaration and attend at a cross-examination in support of the certification of this action or in the event of a summary judgment application brought against the plaintiffs. [19] The Settlement Agreement provides that the plaintiffs will apply to the court after the settlement approval hearing for approval of a settlement administration plan. The Settling Defendants will not have standing to make submissions regarding the settlement administration plan. [20] The plaintiffs and Settling Defendants seek to have the action certified as a class proceeding solely for the purpose of and in accordance with the Settlement Agreement. Counsel referred me to a number of cases that confirm that the court has the authority to certify a claim for the purposes of settlement: Haney Iron Works Ltd. v. Manufacturers Life Insurance Co. , [1998] B.C.J. No. 2936 (S.C.); Bodnar v. The Cash Store Inc. , 2010 BCSC 145 at paras. 15, 32; Wilson v. Depuy International Ltd. , 2018 BCSC 1192 at paras. 49-51. [21] The court also has the power to approve a partial settlement of multi-defendant proceedings and has exercised that power to certify a class proceeding against only some defendants for the purpose of approving a partial settlement of the proceeding with those defendants: Main v. Cadbury Schweppes plc , 2010 BCSC 816 at para. 15; Green v. Tecumseh Products of Canada Limited , 2016 BCSC 217 at paras. 1, 6-15; Cantlie v. Canadian Heating Products Inc. , 2015 BCSC 1225 at paras. 1, 4-6. The court encourages such partial settlements: Sun-Rype Products Ltd. v. Archer Daniels Midland Company , 2010 BCSC 472 at para. 20. [22] Despite the fact that the Settling Defendants consent to certification for settlement purposes the court must still be satisfied that the claim meets the statutory requirements for certification as set out in s. 4(1) of the Act . [23] In the settlement context the requirements for class certification may be relaxed or need not be as rigorously applied: Wilson , at para. 50. [24] Where an action is being certified as a class proceeding only for the purpose of settlement against some defendants a determination that the criteria for certification has been satisfied should be without prejudice to whether those criteria are satisfied for the remaining defendants: Green , at para. 11. That is the case in the application before me. [25] The Settling Defendants consent to the class certification for the purposes of settlement. [26] Taking into consideration the requirements of s. 4(1) of the Act , I am satisfied that this action should be certified as a class action for the purposes of the Settlement Agreement for the following reasons: a) The notice of civil claim discloses causes of action for unlawful conspiracy and fraudulent or negligent misrepresentation. In addition, the plaintiffs propose to bring claims in statutory secondary market liability in respect of the private placements with Beleave Inc. Assuming all the facts pleaded in this action are true, it is not plain and obvious that the plaintiffs’ claim cannot succeed. b) There is an identifiable class of two or more persons (being all persons other than the defendants and any other defined excluded persons) who acquired securities in the defendant corporate issuers at the relevant time periods set out in the notice of civil claim. The defined class is rationally connected to the proposed common issues and provides objective criteria by which individuals can determine if they are members of the class. c) The claims of the class members raises a common issue which, for the purposes of the settlement, is: whether misrepresentations were made in the public disclosure made by Beleave Inc. concerning the private placements as described in the notice of civil claim which closed on April 27, 2018 and June 12, 2018. d) A class proceeding is the preferable procedure for the fair and efficient resolution of the common issues since the common issues predominate over any individual issues to the extent that no other means of resolving the claim would be more practical or efficient. e) The evidence supports my finding that Michael Tietz and Duane Loewen are suitable representative plaintiffs and would fairly and adequately represent the interests of the class, they have proposed a settlement agreement in a workable form for resolving the proceeding, and do not have an interest in the common issues which conflicts with the interests of the other class members. [27] Accordingly, for the purposes of this application, I order that the action be certified as a class action and that Michael Tietz and Duane Loewen are appointed as the representative plaintiffs. [28] The applicable principles for the approval of a settlement under ss. 35(1) and (3) of the Act are summarized in Bodnar, at paras. 16-21 : a) The standard for approval of a settlement is whether the settlement is fair, reasonable, and in the best interests of the class as a whole. b) The court is not required to dissect the proposed settlement with an eye to perfection. Instead, the question is whether the settlement falls within a zone or range of reasonableness. c) The court is not entitled to modify the terms of a negotiated settlement. d) In considering whether to approve a settlement, the court must consider the litigation risks and benefits in proceeding with the action. The court’s function is to determine whether there are any disadvantages to the settlement that are sufficient to justify its rejection. e) Counsel’s recommendation that a settlement be approved should be given significance by the court. When the proposed class settlement has been negotiated at arm’s length by class counsel there is a presumption of fairness. f) In evaluating the reasonableness of a settlement the court may consider evidence concerning the expected participation in the settlement by class members as a factor in assessing the sufficiency of the funds available to compensate class members under the terms of the settlement. [29] The advantages of the Settlement Agreement are: a) The financial benefit to the class of $2,400,000 is significant, particularly given the risks of the action not being successful at the statutory leave stage, certification stage, and at trial and due to the financial circumstances of Beleave Inc. The Settling Defendants are unlikely to have the means to satisfy a judgment for the damages sought by the plaintiffs and continuing with the litigation means the insurance funds will be diminished until little or nothing is left. b) The agreement obliges the Settling Defendants to cooperate in the continued prosecution of the litigation. This is a significant non-monetary benefit to the putative class members. c) Claims of the class members in respect of their purchases of shares in Beleave Inc. will continue against the remaining defendants. This includes those who were involved in the acquisition of shares in Beleave Inc. under the two private placements at issue, those involved in the subsequent sale of the shares, and the other defendants who entered into or arranged the consulting agreements with Beleave Inc. as part of the private placement transactions. d) The Settlement Agreement provides that the plaintiffs will not claim from the remaining defendants any portion of loss that the court may ultimately attribute to the fault of the Settling Defendants, and in those circumstances fairly and properly bars the remaining defendants from making any claims of contribution or indemnity against the Settling Defendants. [30] There do not appear to be any disadvantages to the Settlement Agreement in the circumstances. [31] Plaintiffs’ counsel are experienced class action counsel who pursued the action diligently. All aspects of the Settlement Agreement have been approved by the representative plaintiffs, the Settlement Defendants, and the insurer. [32] Taking the above factors into account and the fact the agreement has been consented to, I am satisfied that the Settlement Agreement is fair and reasonable and in the best interests of those affected by it. [33] The plaintiffs’ application for approval of the Settlement Agreement is granted. [34] The plaintiffs may take their order as sought with the two changes discussed by counsel on December 14, 2020: the changes to paragraph seven as put forth by the defendant PreveCeutical Medical Inc. and the additional order that nothing in the Settlement Agreement derogates from or otherwise limits the plaintiffs’ document production obligations in this action, as consented to by the plaintiffs and the Settling Defendants. “Wilkinson J.”"},"meta":{},"created_at":"2022-03-10T01:19:20.468153Z","updated_at":"2022-03-10T01:19:20.468160Z","project":3},{"id":68,"annotations":[{"id":74,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"start":3,"end":40,"text":"THE SUPREME COURT OF BRITISH COLUMBIA","labels":["COURT_NAME"]},"id":"40d36c5a-9","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":146,"end":152,"text":"K.T.T.","labels":["PERS_APPELLANT"]},"id":"40d36c5b-9","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":166,"end":172,"text":"J.J.T.","labels":["PERS_RESPONDENT"]},"id":"40d36c5c-9","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":193,"end":235,"text":"The Honourable Mr. Justice G.C.

J.J.T.,   2021 BCSC 131 Date: 20210111 Docket: E210022 Registry:  Vancouver Between: K.T.T. Claimant And J.J.T. Respondent Before:  The Honourable Mr. Justice G.C. Weatherill Oral Reasons for Judgment In  Chambers Counsel for the Claimant, appearing by teleconference: C. Alvarez Gomez Counsel for the Respondent, appearing by teleconference: J. Stein Place and Date of Hearing: Vancouver, B.C. January 11, 2021 Place and Date of Judgment: Vancouver, B.C. January 11, 2021   [1]     THE COURT:  The claimant mother applies for orders requiring and  facilitating the return to BC of one of the two children of the parties’  marriage, who I will refer to as “M.”. The claimant says that on January  4, 2021, M. was wrongfully removed from BC by the respondent father and taken  to his home in Los Angeles. [2]     The parties and their two children are Canadian citizens. The parties  began cohabiting in a marriage‑like relationship in January 2000. They  were married on November 26, 2004. They have two children, M., who is  currently nine years old; and C., who is currently 13 years old.  [3]     In October 2013, when M. was two years of age, the parties moved with  the children from BC to Los Angeles where they have been living and  working ever since. The parties purchased a home in Studio City, California,  and received their green cards in April 2019. Studio City is a suburb of  Los Angeles. The children have been attending and continue to attend  school there, albeit remotely. [4]     On June 16, 2020, the claimant drove with the children from  Los Angeles to BC to visit family and friends. She intended to return to  Los Angeles in approximately six weeks, in time for the children to return  to school on August 17, 2020.  [5]     In late August 2020, the claimant determined that it would be best if  she extended her stay in BC to September 7, 2020 because of the COVID  pandemic and the extreme forest fires that were taking place along the west  coast of California.  [6]     On September 22, 2020, the claimant sent the following email to the  respondent: Hi Jason.  So I am thinking it would be best  to stay here in Canada a bit longer – maybe another month. In terms of Covid and  the California fires, it is much safer for the kids to be here and I do not  feel comfortable travelling back at this time. They are doing fine with their  online school, and having extended family here, being able to go to parks, and  do things is good for their well being. We are also still waiting for their  new passports, which will hopefully arrive this month. [7]     The respondent responded approximately one-and-a-half hours later as  follows: As we agreed in our last conversations you stay until  September 7 to stay in Canada not any longer. I will not allow them to  stay any longer in Canada so this is not for you to decide soely [ sic ].  You have had almost 3 weeks since we’ve last talked to get  the passports in order so. As reviewed in our last email, you said they would  be coming home the long weekend and you’ll be back by around the seventh, please  let me know what date you were going to be arriving.  Covid is not an issue in studio city.   There are no forest fires in southern California los Angeles district so  you do not need to worry about any of the hysteria you were seeing on  television. It does not affect our way of living. [8]     On September 10, 2020, the claimant responded: Just following up on our last  email. In doing what is best for the kids, we will be staying in BC longer. [9]     The respondent responded: Can you give me a timeline please? [10]     September 15, 2020, the claimant wrote again: Just following up on our conversation from last week ...  Honestly, I do think it would be  best for the kids and I to stay here more long term, and I would like us to  stay here for the foreseeable future. Obviously the two of us should keep  discussing the long‑term plan as the situation develops, but truthfully  I think it is better for the kids and I to just stay here. I understand  with COVID that it would be difficult to see them at this time. Hopefully,  that will change soon. Either way, I encourage you and the kids to have more  communication in the interim. [11]     On September 19, 2020, the claimant wrote to the respondent again: This email is to clarify our  family situation going forward. I’d like to re-affirm that it is clearly  unsafe to travel back to Los Angeles at this time. The fact is we will be  returning when it is safe to drive without fear of smoke, fires, lack of  accommodation en route (due to fires), plus Covid. I trust that we can be  reasonable about this for the sake of our children’s well being. I do still  believe it would be best for us to remain in Canada for the foreseeable future,  however, I understand that I cannot remain here without your consent.   Therefore, it is my intention to return to Los Angeles when it is safe. I  would appreciate if you could recognize our unique situation in an  unprecedented time. It’s not about keeping the kids from you. It’s about the  kids and keeping them safe, happy and healthy. I believe you also desire the  safety of our children. Do you agree that I should stay here in Canada at  least for the time being? If you don’t believe the safety of our children is  paramount and do not provide me consent to stay in Canada, I will prepare for  the return trip to the United States immediately. [12]     The respondent’s responding email is dated September 24, 2020. It is  lengthy and describes the love he feels for the claimant and the children,  difficulties the parties have had over the years and the hurt they have  experienced in their relationship. He went on to write: I will no longer ask you and the  children to come back home to California. This makes no sense and is totally  unproductive to dealing with our issues moving forward, together or not. I  need you to understand I have been advised that if I don’t take legal action  immediately, I lose my ability to secure shared custody of the children. After  my discussion with [C], I have decided it would not be good to proceed with  this action and feel it will further tear the family apart. so I’m going to  trust you and leave it in your hands to be fair when it comes to the children  if we proceed with separation. I’m not relinquishing custody of the children  as they are my life (as are you) but I don’t want to traumatize the children  any further. [C] is too vulnerable right now and is being affected because of  our actions in our relationship, and [M] is too close to you, and I wouldn’t  want to separate her from her mother…I wouldn’t want it any differently. If  you want to relocate and stay in Canada, I will not try and stop you. I want  you and the children to be happy. [13]     I should say in passing that my reference to C. is to the other older  daughter. [14]     The respondent later wrote that: Things will be amicable between  us, and we will work it out. [15]     He wrote again on October 1, 2020, while in BC visiting the children: If you are planning to stay in  Canada, please confirm it is your intent to reside here long term. If so,  please confirm your acknowledgment you will be giving up your US residence and  green card. ... The respondent went on to discuss parenting time with  and parenting responsibility of the children going forward.  [16]     The claimant secured rental accommodation for her and the children in  Surrey, BC. As already stated, the children continued to attend their  California school remotely.  [17]     The respondent travelled to BC and had parenting time with the children  in October and during the period of November 22, 2020 to January 4, 2021.   Parenting time was informal and was roughly on a week‑on\/week‑off  basis during that period. [18]     The respondent commenced divorce proceedings in California on  November 19, 2020. The claimant was served with those proceedings on December  11, 2020 and has since attorned to the jurisdiction of the California courts.  [19]     The respondent took the children to Whistler between Christmas and New  Year’s Day. He planned to return to California alone on January 1, 2021. When  he dropped the children off at the claimant’s home that day, M. informed her  parents that she wanted to return home to California with her father. She was  insistent. The police were called and interviewed the parties separately. M.  stayed with the respondent who delayed his return to California to January 4,  2021 to see if M. changed her mind. She continued to be insistent that she  wanted to return to her home in California with her father. The claimant did  not consent to her doing so. [20]     On January 4, 2021, the respondent drove with M. across the US border. M.  did not have any travel documentation because it was in the possession of the  claimant. Both M. and the respondent were questioned extensively by customs  officers regarding the appropriateness of them returning to California with her  father without any travel documentation. The questioning lasted two-and-a-half  hours, during which time customs officers were apprised of the claimant’s lack  of consent. The officers nevertheless allowed the respondent and M. to enter  the United States. They arrived home on January 5, 2021. [21]     On January 6, 2021, the claimant filed a notice of family claim as  well as this application. Her counsel appeared before Justice Skolrood of  this court on an  ex parte  basis. Justice Skolrood declined to hear the  application on an  ex parte  basis but did grant the claimant short leave  to serve the materials upon the respondent for today’s hearing.  [22]     The respondent filed his application response on January 8, 2021. On  that same day, despite having previously agreed that C. could stay in BC with  the claimant, he filed an Article 16 Notice under the Hague Convention, seeking  an order returning C. to California. The Article 16 Notice will be heard in BC  by way of petition, which I am told will be filed by the respondent shortly. [23]     The claimant has deposed that she and the children have been victims of  a history of physical and emotional abuse at the hands of the respondent. The  respondent denies physically or emotionally abusing any of them. Given the  state of the conflicting evidence this court is in no position today to make  any determination regarding whether or not the respondent is responsible for  family violence. [24]     M. has been what the parties describe as a “handful” for the parties for  many months, if not years. She has gotten angry, talked back, and lashed out  at her parents on many occasions. She suffers from gender-identity issues.   She has expressed suicidal ideations to the parties. In the fall of 202,0  while in BC, she commenced an assessment program at the BC Children’s Hospital,  although she only attended one appointment prior to her returning to California  on January 4, 2021. The respondent has deposed that since returning to  California, M. has been happy, healthy, and has not expressed any further  suicidal thoughts. [25]     Articles 3 and 16 of the Hague Convention provide in relevant part that,  3: 3. The removal or retention of a child is to be  considered wrongful where:  (a) it is in breach of rights of custody attributed to a  person and institution or any other body, either jointly or alone, under the  law of the state in which the child was habitually resident immediate by before  the removal or retention, and (b) at the time of removal or retention, those rights were  actually exercised, either jointly or alone, or would have been so exercised  but for the removal or retention. The rights of custody mentioned in subparagraph (a) above may  arise in particular by operation of law or by reason of judicial administrative  decision or by reason of an agreement having legal effect under the law of that  state. 16. After receiving notice  of a wrongful removal or retention of a child in the sense of article 3, the  judicial or administrative authority is of the contracting state to which the  child has been removed or which it has been retained shall not decide on the  merits of rights of custody until it has been determined that the child is not  to be returned under this convention or unless an application under this  convention is not lodged within a reasonable time following receipt of the  notice. [26]     The parties have had joint custodial and parenting rights with respect  to the children since their birth. Since 2013, they have lived with the  children in California and have exercised those joint custodial and parenting  rights in that jurisdiction, where M. has been habitually resident since she  was two years old. After the claimant travelled to BC with the children in mid  June 2020, she decided to relocate permanently here. Although the respondent  initially insisted that the claimant and the children return to California, he  eventually capitulated and agreed not to oppose them staying in BC. However,  he made it clear he was not prepared to relinquish his rights as a custodial  parent. [27]     As the Article 16 Notice relates only to C., I find it is not a  significant consideration in determining the merits of the claimant’s  application. Rather, I agree with claimant’s counsel that the application must  be determined under s. 77 of the  Family Law Act , S.B.C. 2011, c. 25  [ FLA ], which has become known as the  FLA ’s equivalent to Article  16. The issues to be determined is whether it is in the best interests of M.  to make an interim order that she be returned to BC. [28]     Although the respondent did acquiesce in the children staying in BC, once  M. defiantly made it clear she did not wish to stay here, that consent yielded  to M.’s insistent wishes. I am satisfied, on the evidence as a whole that M.  made it clear to the parties in early January 2021 that it was her strong  desire to return home to California with her father.  [29]     It goes without saying that although, generally speaking, a child of  nine years of age may be entitled to a voice, she is not entitled to a choice.   However, in the circumstances of this case, I find that her voice is,  nevertheless, a factor that must be considered when determining her best  interests.  [30]     That said, however, in my view there is simply insufficient evidence  before the court to enable it to make a determination as to the best interests  of M. The evidence in this case regarding whether it is in M.’s best interests  to stay with her father in California or be ordered to return to her mother in BC  is that of the parties alone. Each of them contradicts the other. There is no  independent, objective evidence upon which an accurate assessment can be made. [31]     I am guided in this case by the comments of Justice Marzari in the  decision of this court in  Price v. Srivastva , 2020 BCSC 1109, at paras.  41 to 44 inclusive: [41] Division 7 of Part 4 of the  FLA  governs  jurisdictional issues with respect to guardianship, parenting arrangements, or  contact with the children. Section 74(3) of the  FLA  contains a  forum  non conveniens  provision: (3) A court may decline to make an order under this Part if  the court considers that it is more appropriate for jurisdiction to be  exercised outside British Columbia.  [42] In assessing whether the court should decline to  exercise jurisdiction with respect to guardianship, parenting arrangements, or  contact, it is useful to consider the purposes set out in s. 73 of the  FLA :    73 The purposes of this Division are as follows:  (a) to ensure that court applications respecting  guardianship, parenting arrangements or contact with a child are determined on  the basis of the best interests of the child; (b) to avoid the making of orders respecting guardianship,  parenting arrangements or contact with a child, respecting the same child, in  more than one jurisdiction; (c) to discourage child abduction as an alternative to  determining by due process the guardianship of, or parenting arrangements with  respect to, a child; (d) to provide for effective enforcement of orders  respecting guardianship, parenting arrangements or contact with a child, and  for the recognition and enforcement of extraprovincial orders.  [43] The factors that apply on a  forum non conveniens   analysis, and which are engaged under s. 74(3) of the  FLA , are  codified in s. 11 of the  CJPTA: Shortridge‑Tsuchiya  [ v.  Tsuchiya , 2010 BCCA 61] at para. 60. Section 11 of the  CJPTA   provides as follows:  Discretion as to the exercise of territorial competence 11 (1) After considering the interests of the parties to a  proceeding and the ends of justice, a court may decline to exercise its  territorial competence in the proceeding on the ground that a court of another  state is a more appropriate forum in which to hear the proceeding.  (2) A court, in deciding the question of whether it or a  court outside British Columbia is the more appropriate forum in which to hear a  proceeding, must consider the circumstances relevant to the proceeding,  including (a) the comparative convenience and expense for the parties  to the proceeding and for their witnesses, in litigating in the court or in any  alternative forum, (b) the law to be applied to issues in the proceeding,  (c) the desirability of avoiding multiplicity of legal  proceedings,  (d) the desirability of avoiding conflicting decisions in  different courts,  (e) the enforcement of an eventual judgment, and  (f) the fair and efficient working of the Canadian legal  system as a whole.  [44] These factors are not  exhaustive. In determining whether to decline jurisdiction, the court can  consider other relevant factors such as the purposes set out in s. 73 of  the  FLA , including the best interest of the children:  Shortridge‑Tsuchiya   at para. 61. [32]     Many of those factors are neutral in this case. However, having  considered those that are relevant and must be considered, which I have done, I  agree with respondent’s counsel that this court should decline to exercise  territorial competence under both s. 74(3) of the  FLA  and s. 11  of the  Court Jurisdiction and Proceedings Transfer Act , S.B.C. 2003, c.  28 in favour of the courts of California. [33]     This was not a case of “abduction” in the usual sense. A proceeding was  commenced in California by the respondent in November of 2020. It was served  on the claimant on December 11, 2020. The claimant has attorned to that  jurisdiction by responding to the proceeding. It is desirable that multiple  proceedings between two jurisdictions be avoided. There will be no difficulty  enforcing the eventual judgment in BC. The comparative convenience and expense  for the parties and their witnesses likely favours California when the parties  and their children have resided there for the past seven years. [34]     In my view, California is the appropriate forum in this case.   Accordingly, the claimant’s application is dismissed. [35]     Do the parties wish to address costs?  [SUBMISSIONS  ON COSTS] [36]     THE COURT: Thank you. I have considered the issue of costs already,  and in my view, there was a  bona fide  issue here. There will be no  order as to costs. “G.C.

January 13, 2020  Place and Date of Judgment: Victoria, B.C. January   13, 2020 [1]     THE COURT:  On July 29, 2019, I released a ruling on the  plaintiffs' motion to rely on sworn statements. That was reported at 2019 BCSC  1243. In that ruling I accepted that there were two parts to the necessity  test. The first is whether the witness is unable to attend trial. Obviously  Wesley Modeste is not. I found that the evidence to support the cognitive  decline of Mabel Mitchell was lacking and that the plaintiffs did not establish  the first part of the necessity test with respect to her. I granted leave to the  plaintiffs to adduce better medical evidence to establish her inability to  attend trial. [2]     After the first part of the necessity test has been met, the court is to  assess threshold reliability of the evidence. I heard submissions on the  threshold reliability at the application in July 2019, and I accepted that Wes  Modeste's affidavit had met the threshold reliability test for the following  reasons, which were set out in my reasons, but perhaps not clearly enough.   Firstly, it is a sworn statement. Secondly, it sets out his personal memory.   Thirdly, it sets out oral history which will be subject to the global oral  history objection along with all the other oral history evidence. Fourthly,  Mr. Modeste's father was a Chief and was a family orator who presided over  ceremonies, so was a man of influence in his community. Fifthly, Mr. Modeste  himself was an elected councillor and Chief and therefore, also a respected  member of the community. [3]     For these reasons, I find that the threshold test for reliability and  the first part of the necessity test has been met for the Modeste statement. [4]     I have not made an assessment on the threshold reliability of Mabel  Mitchell's statutory declaration, although I did make some comments about it.   Those comments should be considered  obiter  and not a ruling on the  threshold reliability. [5]     The second part of the necessity test is whether the admission of the  written statement is necessary to prove a relevant fact in this case. [6]     I found that I cannot rule on that until I know what the other  plaintiffs' witnesses say, and this will require submissions from counsel after  the plaintiffs' evidence is in. I do not see the need to file a further notice  of application, but it would be helpful to have counsel circulate outlines of  their arguments in advance so everyone is prepared to argue about the necessity  of the statement at the end of the plaintiffs' case. [7]     If the second part of the necessity test is met, I will then need to  assess the ultimate reliability at the end of trial. [8]     The next question is about the timing of when the written statement of  Wesley Modeste should be read in. It was my intention to have Mr. Modeste's affidavit  read in prior to the oral history objection so that it could be dealt with in  that ruling. The exercise of reading the statement does not mean that the  ultimate necessity and reliability has been accepted because the objections are  still pending, much like they were with the other oral history evidence. [9]     The word “admissibility”, I think, has created some confusion. For  example, in para. 92 of the ruling when I said acceptance of “... admissibility  is not particularly high. A finding of admissibility does not imply acceptance  of the evidence by the trier of fact”, it would have been more clear if  reworded to say “acceptance of threshold reliability does not imply acceptance  of the evidence by the trier of fact.” [10]     On December 16, 2019, at the case management conference, there was some  discussion about reading in the affidavit while we are sitting in Duncan so  that Mr. Modeste's family could be in attendance. On that day after hearing  the proposed schedule, I thought there would be insufficient time to conclude  all the  viva voce  testimony and that the Modeste statement would have to  be read in in Victoria but that we could accommodate the family with a video  connection. I will not make a firm direction on scheduling until our next  judicial management conference, which is on Wednesday. It appears with the new  time estimates I received on Friday that we may have enough time to complete  the three  viva voce  witnesses within the two weeks, in which case there  would not be time to read in the Modeste statement in any event, but I will  hear more about that on Wednesday. [11]     So just in conclusion, there are five steps to admitting the written  statement. Firstly, the threshold necessity, which has been met for Mr. Modeste,  but not for Mrs. Mitchell. Secondly, threshold reliability, which has  been met for Mr. Modeste, but not for Mrs. Mitchell. Thirdly, once steps 1 and  2 are met, the statement should be read into the record subject to further  objections to oral history evidence contained therein and ultimate necessity of  the statement and the timing of that to be determined. [12]     Fourthly, at the end of the plaintiffs' case all parties will make  submissions on whether the statement was necessary to prove a material fact in  the plaintiffs' case. [13]     And then finally, fifthly, at the end of the trial, in closing, all  parties will make submissions about the ultimate reliability of the sworn  statement. [14]     Mabel Mitchell's statement has not met any of the above tests, so a  continuation of the application must be scheduled by requisition to assess the  new affidavit and medical evidence to see if the threshold necessity and  threshold reliability tests are met. Counsel should exchange brief outlines of  their argument in advance of the hearing of that continuation of the  application.  “B.  M.

Sun , Vancouver Dockets S1611338 and S1611176) Counsel for the Appellant: D.K. Fitzpatrick Counsel for the Respondent: J.D. Shields Place and Date of Hearing: Vancouver, British   Columbia December 21, 2018 Place and Date of Judgment with Written Reasons to Follow: Vancouver, British   Columbia December 21, 2018 Place and Date of Written Reasons: Vancouver, British   Columbia January 25, 2019     Summary: Dismissal of application for  stay of an order of incarceration on a finding of contempt. Reasons for Judgment of the Honourable  Madam Justice Newbury: [1]     On December 21, 2018, Mr. Sun’s application for a stay of an  incarceration order following a finding of contempt was before me in chambers.  I dismissed the application with reasons to follow. [2]     Mr. Sun was found personally liable, and liable as the principal of  Besco International Investment Co. Ltd. Judgments were granted in the Supreme  Court against them in July and September 2018 respectively, in the total  principal amount of $1,476,823.78 plus (special) costs and interest. As of  November 13, 2018, the total amount owing was $1,652,632.36.  [3]     Thereafter, Mr. Sun failed to attend an examination in aid of  execution, avoided service of appointments for examinations in aid, failed to  produce documents he had agreed to produce, and failed to provide satisfactory  answers to questions on examination. A registrar certified on November 8 and 9,  2018 that Mr. Sun had failed to pay the judgments without reasonable  excuse and had failed to provide satisfactory answers to questions about his  ability to do so. [4]     The matter then came before Madam Justice Matthews on November 22, 2018.  She ordered  inter alia  that Mr. Sun be incarcerated for six days  and then have 30 days to pay. If payment was not made by December 27, he was to  be incarcerated for a further 30 days. The judge stated in her reasons: There is evidence that Mr. Sun and Besco have  considerable means to satisfy the judgments. Funds well in excess of the  judgment have gone through the Besco bank accounts. Mr. Sun admitted at  his examination in aid of execution that he is capable of borrowing the funds  to satisfy the judgment. He identified funds in corporate bank accounts which  he has access to which could have been paid in partial satisfaction of the  judgment. He agreed to pay those funds in partial satisfaction of the judgment,  but has not done so. There is evidence that he has wilfully taken steps to avoid  being able to pay the judgment, including that he gave three vehicles, one  Bentley and two Range Rovers, to friends. He owns a home on the west side of  Vancouver worth five million dollars. It is encumbered by eight million dollars  in debt to friends. The law pertaining to committal of a party for failing to  comply with a court order was summarized by Mr. Justice Macintosh in  Fitzgerald  Living Trust v. Mountainstar Gold Inc. , 2018 BCSC 1451, based on the  decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in  Carey v. Laiken , 2015 SCC 17.  The first element that must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt is that the  order alleged to have been breached must state clearly and unequivocally what  should and should not be done. The second element is that the party alleged to  have breached the order must have actual acknowledge of it. Finally, the party  allegedly in breach must have intentionally done the act that the order  prohibits or intentionally failed to do the act that the order prohibits. I conclude that each of these  tests [has] been met in this case and the evidence before me is satisfactory to  meet those tests beyond a reasonable doubt. [At paras. 7-10.] Matthews J. was satisfied Mr. Sun had intentionally  avoided paying the judgments or failed to pay them although he had argued at an  examination that he could borrow the money to do so, and the evidence showed he  had “access to assets in excess of the judgment amount and has disposed of some  of his assets to avoid paying the judgment.” (At para. 13.) [5]     In his argument on behalf of Mr. Sun in this court on December 21,  2018, Mr. Kirkpatrick said all that could be said in favour of his client.  He painted Mr. Sun as a person who has many assets but whose ability to  pay is impaired at the present time. He asked for 90 days in which his client  should, he suggested, be able to borrow the money to pay the judgments. At  times he seemed to suggest the money could definitely be found; at other times  he said his client was willing to pay “but cannot”. He described Mr. Sun as  a “poor manager” whose finances are intertwined with those of his family, which  makes it difficult for him to extricate the required amount. [6]     Mr. Shields, on behalf of the creditor, referred on the other hand  to evidence that suggested Mr. Sun has been preferring other creditors  over San Bao and that substantial funds over which Mr. Sun has control  have simply “disappeared” without explanation. As far as the debt owing to San  Bao is concerned, no real attempts have been made to pay anything; documents  including financial statements and income tax returns of Besco have not been produced  despite being promised; and there is no indication Mr. Sun has made any  effort to persuade his family to help pay his debts. Most tellingly, his  answers to questions regarding his various companies were highly unsatisfactory  and difficult to credit, given the large amounts of money he had previously  claimed to control. All of this conduct is remarkably similar to the conduct  described by Mr. Justice Steeves in his reasons for the original judgment  that confirmed the indebtedness of Mr. Sun and his company: see 2018 BCSC  1128.  [7]     The criteria for the granting of a stay are well known – whether the  applicant has raised an arguable case on appeal; the question of irreparable  harm if a stay should not or should be granted; the balance of convenience; and  most importantly, the interests of justice. On a consideration of these  factors, I am simply unconvinced that interests of justice are such that a stay  should be granted. As I have already observed, Mr. Sun has repeatedly  neglected to obey court orders, to appear at examinations in aid, to provide  documents he has been ordered to provide, and has failed utterly in providing  relevant information to the creditor concerning his financial position and that  of Besco. [8]     For all the foregoing reasons, the application was dismissed. “The  Honourable Madam Justice Newbury”"},"meta":{},"created_at":"2022-03-10T01:19:20.467927Z","updated_at":"2022-03-10T01:19:20.467934Z","project":3},{"id":65,"annotations":[{"id":71,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"start":0,"end":40,"text":"IN THE SUPREME COURT OF BRITISH COLUMBIA","labels":["COURT_NAME"]},"id":"p4IHiqI4ll","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":51,"end":112,"text":"1164803 BC Ltd. v.

[2] The defendant consented to the show cause hearing and the merits hearing occurring together, and did not dispute that the preliminary show cause test was met. Rather their submissions were devoted to the merits themselves. [3] Turning then to those merits, the plaintiff says that it provided notice of termination of the December 6, 2019 lease in place with the defendant (“Lease”) by at least December 28, 2021. The Lease term ended on October 15, 2021, but the Lease provides that If the Tenant shall continue to occupy the Lease Premises at the expiration of the term of this lease or any renewal period thereof with or without the consent of the landlord and without any further written agreement, the Tenant shall be a monthly Tenant at the rent herein mentioned and on the terms and conditions set out except as to the length of the tenancy. [4] As such, the defendant was on a month‑to‑month Lease at the time of the purported termination, subject to the arguments below. The termination clause in the Lease provides as follows: The Tenant covenants and agrees that on the Landlord’s becoming entitled to re-enter the Leased Premises under any of the provisions of this lease, the Landlord, in addition to all other rights, shall have the right to terminate forthwith this lease and leaving upon the Leased Premises notice of writing of its intention to do so… [5] To the extent that there may have been procedural flaws in any earlier notices, the plaintiff says that the letter sent by plaintiff's counsel to the defendant on December 28, 2021 (the “Notice\") was most assuredly adequate to satisfy the Notice requirements in the Lease. [6] The first issue that must be addressed is whether this Notice was adequate to terminate the Lease. The defendant does not dispute that it was appropriately delivered. However, the defendant says the Notice purported to be on the basis of certain alleged breaches of the Lease and that such breaches have not been established. Absent proof of the breaches, the defendant says that the Notice is ineffective. [7] The portion of the Notice relied upon by the defendant states: In the event that the court finds an issue with our previous notice of termination we hereby confirm termination of the Lease by reason of the foregoing issues and make demand for immediate possession and return of all keys and other security cards or devices and expressly reserve any and all rights and remedies available to the Landlord pursuant to the terms of Lease relevant statute to common law. [8] I note, however, that this paragraph is the second‑to‑last paragraph of a two‑page letter. The letter begins as follows: Further to our letters dated December 7, 2021, and emails advising 1164803 BC Ltd. (the “Landlord”) that the Lease dated December 6, 2019 (the “Lease”) relating to the premises located at Unit 213‑12564 88 Avenue, Surrey, British Columbia, (the “Premises”) termination on October 15, 2021, and the Landlord requires immediate possession. [9] For the purposes of this application, the plaintiff does not seek to rely on the establishment of any alleged breaches. Rather the plaintiff argues that so long as notice of termination was provided in a timely fashion, there is no need for any breach to be established. The defendant agrees that if the plaintiff had simply relied on the effluxion of time the Notice would be valid, subject to the other arguments addressed below. However, the defendant suggests that the plaintiff is bound by their stated basis for termination, which was the (unestablished) breaches. [10] I do not agree. The plaintiff did not need a reason to terminate the Lease: Mandaville Court v. Muise , 2008 NSSM 11 at paras. 35-39. So long as the letter serves as notice of termination, it should be treated as valid. The references to potential breaches by the plaintiff were simply redundant. Their inclusion does not invalidate the Notice completely. The Notice, when read as a whole, is certainly sufficient to advise the defendant that the plaintiff no longer wanted the Lease to continue. [11] The next issue is whether or not the plaintiff was in a position to terminate. On this point the defendant argues that the plaintiff was not in such a position because the defendant had already exercised its option to renew the Lease for a further two years as of March 15, 2021. [12] The Lease did provide for the potential for the tenant to exercise such a right. However, the difficulty for the defendant is that its notice of renewal was not delivered in a manner provided for in the Lease. The first point to note is that the plaintiff denies ever having received the March 15, 2021 communication from the defendant. The defendant offers no evidence that this denial is untrue. The plaintiff's own subsequent conduct is consistent with not having received the communication. Specifically, on March 30, 2021, the plaintiff delivered a text message to the defendant inquiring about its interest in a renewal, without any mention of any earlier communication from the defendant. Given the available evidence, I accept that the plaintiff did not receive the defendant's March 15, 2021 communication. [13] As noted, the plaintiff did not deliver the communication in a manner set out in the Lease. The Lease provides that \"all notices…which may or are required to be given pursuant to this lease shall be in writing and shall be sufficiently given if delivered, or during times the post office is operating normally, mailed prepaid and registered.\" There is no dispute that the communication was not delivered by registered mail. [14] The defendant suggests that the use of the word \"sufficiently\" in the Notice clause means that there could be other means of providing notice. I disagree. The words preceding \"sufficiently\" are \"shall be\", implying that the condition is mandatory. Secondly, the word \"sufficiently\" does not necessarily imply that there are other ways in which notice may be given. Rather, the proper interpretation, particularly in the face of the use of the words \"shall be\", suggests that only mail delivered in that form shall be “sufficient”. I also note that there is a specific clause that opens the door to the parties agreeing to other forms of notice, but the defendant does not argue that this provision is triggered here. [15] The benefit and need for registered mail are reflected in this very case. If the defendant's communication had been registered, then there would have been no debate about whether or not there was a delivery. The defendant would have had virtually overwhelming proof of delivery through the provision of the registration documentation provided with registered mail. [16] The defendant argues in the alternative that the court should grant relief from forfeiture, or alternatively, apply broader equitable principles in order to deem its notice effective, relying on SCP 173 Dining Limited v. Costa del Sol Holdings, 2021 BCSC 1252 at paras. 81-83; 112-114. I decline to adopt either alternative. [17] To the extent that both routes call for the court to consider the equities of the situation, I find that the equities weigh in favour of the plaintiff. a) There is no evidence that the plaintiff breached any term of the Lease. b) There is evidence that the plaintiff changed its position in reliance on the lack of response to their inquiry of the defendant about possible renewal. Specifically, the plaintiff made successful efforts to negotiate the sale of the property to a buyer who expects clear title without any tenancies. Furthermore, the plaintiff provided that there were no ongoing tenancies in its property disclosure statement. Invoking the principles of equity to maintain the defendant's tenancy would potentially put the plaintiff in breach of their contractual or tort obligations to the proposed purchaser. This is not the type of difficulty that can be remedied by the defendant simply bringing its lease payments up‑to‑date, for example. c) The innocent third-party purchaser would also be potentially damaged by the court invoking equitable principles, given that it would only be able to assume possession of the property if tied to the array of obligations owed to a commercial tenant such as the defendant. d) Turning to the position of the defendant, they are, at least in part, the author of their own misfortune. Specifically, after receiving the text communication from the plaintiff, it should have been abundantly obvious that the plaintiff had not received the earlier communication from the defendant. It would have been a simple thing for the defendant to say to the plaintiff, “did you not receive our communication on March 15?”, in which case all of these litigation complications would almost certainly have been avoided. e) The defendant suggests that the plaintiff does not come to court with clean hands as a result of the fact that they made allegations of breach that were not justified, and which were never made known during the tenancy. Given my finding above, the issue of the alleged breach is somewhat of a red herring in that the plaintiff does not rely upon them, and I have concluded that the plaintiff did not need to rely upon the breaches in order to justify a termination. Furthermore, in terms of the timing of raising any breaches, the Lease contains a non-waiver clause stating: No condoning, excusing or overlooking by the Landlord of any default, breach or non-observance by the Tenant at any time or times with respect to any covenant, proviso or condition herein contained shall operate as a waiver of the Landlord's right herein with respect to any continuing or subsequent default, breach or non-observance or so as to defeat or affect in any way the rights of the Landlord herein with respect to any such continuing or subsequent default or breach and no waiver shall be inferred from or implied by anything done or omitted by the Landlord, salve only an express waiver in writing. [18] Given all of these factors, I cannot find that there is sufficiently compelling basis to grant relief from forfeiture even assuming it is available: Sechelt Golf and Country Club v Sechelt (District), 2012 BCSC 1105 at para. 128. Nor do I find a basis to evoke any broader equitable principles in order to cure the defendant's failure to provide notice of the exercise of their option for renewal in the proper manner. I conclude that the assertion of the plaintiff's strict legal rights is not unjust or unfair on the facts of this case. [19] Finally, the defendant sought to argue that the plaintiff had breached its contractual duty of good faith. However, even assuming that the court can rely on good faith principles to overcome express contractual provisions, which is doubtful, I do not see any breach of good faith. Insisting on the fulfillment of the black letter notice terms in the Lease is not bad faith. Raising breaches that may not be made out is not necessarily bad faith either. There is no evidence of dishonesty, lying or knowing misleading on the part of the plaintiff. There was no issue regarding the exercise of contractual discretionary powers. The Notice term has no discretionary element. [20] Finally, I see no evidence of unreasonable contractual performance. As the Supreme Court of Canada stated in Wastech Services Ltd. v. Greater Vancouver Sewerage and Drainage District , 2021 SCC 7: [52]… Importantly, whatever variation may come with context, a contracting party — unlike a fiduciary — typically is not required to serve the contractual interests of the other party by duties of good faith performance…. […] [73] … The common law recognizes that “[c]ompetition between businesses regularly involves each business taking steps to promote itself at the expense of the other. . . . Far from prohibiting such conduct, the common law seeks to encourage and protect it” (A.I. Enterprises Ltd. v. Bram Enterprises Ltd., 2014 SCC 12, [2014] 1 S.C.R. 177, at para. 31, citing OBG Ltd. v. Allan, [2007] UKHL 21, [2008] 1 A.C. 1, at para. 142). As a general matter, good faith should not be used as a pretext for scrutinizing motive (Bhasin, at para. 70). [74] Not only does this deferential approach ensure “some elbow-room” for the “aggressive pursuit of self-interest” (C. Sappideen and P. Vines, eds., Fleming’s The Law of Torts (10th ed. 2011), at para. 30.120; see also A.I. Enterprises, at para. 31), but it also prevents good faith from veering into “a form of ad hoc judicial moralism or ‘palm tree’ justice” (Bhasin, at para. 70). In this context, then, courts must only ensure parties have not exercised their discretion in ways unconnected to the purposes for which the contract grants that power… […] [76] With this approach in mind, I stress that what a court considers unreasonable is highly context-specific, and ultimately “depend[s] upon the intention of the parties as disclosed by their contract” (Greenberg, at p. 762; see also Sherry v. CIBC Mortgages Inc., 2016 BCCA 240, 88 B.C.L.R. (5th) 105, at paras. 63 ‑ 65; G. R. Hall, Canadian Contractual Interpretation Law (3rd ed. 2016), at pp. 312 ‑ 13). Demonstrating a breach will necessarily centre on an exercise of contractual interpretation. It is in properly interpreting the contract and the purposes for which discretion was granted that the range of good faith behaviour comes into focus and breaches can be identified… […] [101] Importantly, the duty did not require Metro to subordinate its interests to those of Wastech in exercising its discretionary power in the manner that Wastech claims. The Contract purposely included no guarantee that the Target OR would be achieved. The parties were aware of the risk that the exercise of discretion represented and chose, notwithstanding long negotiations and a detailed agreement, not to constrain the discretion in the way Wastech now requests. In point of fact, Wastech is asking for an advantage for which it did not bargain. It asks, in effect, that Metro confer a benefit upon it that was not contemplated, expressly or impliedly, under the Contract. On my understanding, this stands outside of the “requirement of justice” identified by Cromwell J. in Bhasin (para. 64)… […] [113] I note once again that the duty to exercise discretionary powers in good faith does not require a party to confer a benefit on the other party that was not a part of their original agreement, nor does it require a party to subordinate its interests to those of the other party. [21] As such, for all of the reasons expressed above, I find that the landlord is entitled to a writ of possession effective January 28, 2022.

Ltd., 2019 BCSC 5 Date: 20190103 Docket: S153796 Registry: New Westminster Between: Century 21 Coastal Realty Ltd. and Vipan Sharma Personal Real Estate Corporation Plaintiffs And 0863846 B.C. Ltd., Prabhdev Singh Khera, Jagdev Singh Khera, Sukhpal Singh Khera and Harvir Singh Sidhu Defendants Before: The Honourable Madam Justice Dardi Reasons for Judgment on Costs Counsel for the Plaintiffs: D. Simon Counsel for the Defendants, Prabhdev Singh Khera, Jagdev Singh Khera and Sukhpal Singh Khera: D. Gautam Place and Date of Hearing : New Westminster, B.C. October 5, 2018 Place and Date of Judgment: New Westminster, B.C. January 3, 2019 [1] On August 24, 2017, I issued reasons for judgment indexed at 2017 BCSC 1498 (the “Reasons”). The Court of Appeal decision affirming the Reasons is indexed at 2018 BCCA 298. [2] In the Reasons, I granted liberty to the parties to make submissions on costs. Having heard those submissions, this is my ruling on costs. [3] This dispute arose from a transaction assigning a contract for purchase and sale of certain lands (the “Lands”) to the defendant company. The plaintiffs alleged that a related agreement to list the developed Lands for sale with the plaintiffs, (“the Agreement to List”), was breached when the Lands were subsequently assigned by the defendant company to the three Khera defendants without requiring them to accept the terms of the Agreement to List. The Khera defendants are brothers. [4] The plaintiffs were successful in their claim for inducing breach of contract against the defendant, Prabhdev Khera. The claims against the other two defendants, Jagdev Khera and Sukhpal Khera, were dismissed. [5] The background to the plaintiffs’ claim, my findings of fact and the analysis of the legal issues are set out in detail in the Reasons. I need not repeat them here. [6] For convenience and intending no disrespect, I will refer to the Khera defendants by their given names. [7] On the first day of trial, the plaintiffs discontinued their action against 0863846 BC Ltd. and Harvir Sidhu. The trial, originally set for four days, was heard over the course of seven days. [8] Due to scheduling issues, the plaintiffs did not close their case before the defendants made their opening statement. On September 9, 2016, after the defendants made an opening statement and the final plaintiffs’ witness testified, the plaintiffs indicated that they intended to make an application to amend their pleadings to add a cause of action, that of inducing breach of contract. [9] On November 2, 2016, on the first day of the continuation of the trial, I heard the plaintiffs’ application and allowed the amendment to the pleadings. My November 2, 2016 order stipulated that the costs of the amendment application would be borne by the plaintiffs in any event of the cause. [10] The plaintiffs seek an order that the defendants pay the costs of this proceeding at Scale B, less the costs for the one trial day that was awarded to the defendants for the mid-trial amendment application. The plaintiffs submit that the successful defendants, Jagdev and Sukhpal, are not entitled to their costs, but if they are, the unsuccessful defendant, Prabhdev, ought to pay their costs, pursuant to a Sanderson Order: see Rule 14-16(18) of the Supreme Court Civil Rules , B.C. Reg. 168\/2009 [the Rules ]. [11] The defendants contend that a Sanderson order is not appropriate and that Jagdev and Sukhpal, as the successful defendants, are entitled to an order for costs against the plaintiffs. [12] The defendants further submit that the plaintiffs are entitled to costs against Prabhdev only for the two days of trial that followed the amendment application. In the alternative, the defendants submit that, since they were successful in defending the claim for piercing the corporate veil, there ought to be apportionment of the costs regarding that issue. The defendants contend that this issue occupied approximately 15% of trial time. [13] As the first step in the analysis, I will address whether the successful defendants are entitled to an order for costs. I will then address the issue of who should pay those costs. [14] Rule 14-1(9), states: Costs to follow event (9) Subject to subrule (12), costs of a proceeding must be awarded to the successful party unless the court otherwise orders. [15] The usual rule is that costs follow the event, so that a substantially successful litigant is entitled to recover costs from the unsuccessful party unless the court orders otherwise : Leung v. Chang , 2014 BCSC 1243 at para. 32. Any discretionary exception to the usual rules regarding costs must be made judicially: Bailey v. Victory (1995), 4 B.C.L.R. (3d) 389 at para. 13 (C.A.). [16] As the plaintiffs were ultimately unsuccessful against Jagdev and Sukhpal, the plaintiffs must persuade the Court that the usual rule should be displaced: Grassi v. WIC Radio Ltd. , 2001 BCCA 376 at para. 24. [17] The plaintiff’s primary contention is that Jagdev and Sukhpal, although not legally liable for any alleged wrongdoing, benefited from Prabhdev’s tortious conduct. The plaintiffs rely on the observation of the Court of Appeal at para 37: …it is readily apparent that Prabhdev’s conduct in causing 086 to breach the Agreement to List was for his own personal benefit and that of his brothers . … [Emphasis added.] [18] The plaintiffs also underscore that the three Khera brothers jointly owned and developed the Lands. [19] In my view, there is no principled basis for departing from the usual rule. Jagdev and Sukhpal were entirely successful in defending the action. The fact that they benefitted from Prabhdev’s wrongful conduct does not overcome the plain fact that the plaintiffs invoked the Court’s jurisdiction against them unsuccessfully. [20] In the result, I conclude that the successful defendants, Sukhpal and Jagdev, are entitled to their costs of these proceedings. [21] If Jagdev and Sukhpal are entitled to an order for costs, the plaintiffs seek a Sanderson Order, pursuant to Rule 14-1(18), which provides: Costs of one defendant payable by another (18) If the costs of one defendant against a plaintiff ought to be paid by another defendant, the court may order payment to be made by one defendant to the other directly, or may order the plaintiff to pay the costs of the successful defendant and allow the plaintiff to include those costs as a disbursement in the costs payable to the plaintiff by the unsuccessful defendant. [22] A Sanderson Order requires an unsuccessful defendant to pay the costs of a successful defendant. A similar order, a Bullock Order, requires the plaintiff to pay the costs of the successful defendant, but allows the plaintiff to recover these costs against the unsuccessful defendant: Imperial Salmon House Ltd. v. Kzdzalic (1983), 48 B.C.L.R. 256 at 257-258 (S.C.). [23] The essential difference between these two orders is the allocation of risk. A Bullock order requires the plaintiff to bear the risk of non-payment, whereas a Sanderson order allocates the risk of non-payment to the successful defendant: Normak Investments Ltd. v. Belciug , 2015 BCSC 969 at para. 23 [ Normak ]. [24] In Robertson v. North Island College Technical and Vocational Institute (1980), 26 B.C.L.R. 225 at 228, the Court of Appeal articulated the threshold question under Rule 14-1(18) in these terms: There is a threshold question. It is expressed by Vaughan Williams L.J. in Besterman v. British Motor Cab Company Ltd. 919410 3 K.B. 181, a decision of the English Court of Appeal, at page 186, in this way: Under these circumstances, was it a reasonable thing for the plaintiff in his action against a man who ultimately turns out to be in fact the wrong-doer to join the other defendant in order that the matter might be thoroughly threshed out? [25] The subsequent jurisprudence has clarified that such orders are not to be made whenever it was reasonable for the plaintiff to have sued the successful defendant. The authorities mandate that the conduct of the unsuccessful defendant, such as causing the successful defendant to be brought into the litigation, must warrant an order requiring him or her to reimburse the plaintiff for the successful defendant’s costs ( Normak at para. 24). At this second stage of the analytical framework, the court must exercise its discretion judicially. The key question is whether, having regard to the particular circumstances of the case, it would be fair and just to make a Sanderson Order. [26] The plaintiffs submit that it was reasonable for them to have added the two successful defendants as parties to the action as they had no way of knowing who the shareholders of 0863846 BC Ltd., the corporate defendant, were when they commenced the action. The plaintiffs further assert that all three brothers benefitted from Prabhdev’s wrongful conduct, because Jagdev and Sukhpal were on title of the properties that were subsequently subdivided and sold. Further, the plaintiffs point out that, throughout the course of these proceedings, Jagdev and Sukhpal did not raise any objection to being joined as parties; it is only now at the costs hearing that they raise this issue. [27] The defendants’ overarching submission is that it was not reasonable to join Jagdev and Sukhpal as defendants because there was no legal basis for pursuing a claim against them. They contend that a search of the annual reports of 0863846 BC Ltd. would have revealed that neither of Jagdev and Sukhpal were ever directors or shareholders. I note that the annual report would have disclosed the directors but not the shareholders of the company. In any case, in examination for discovery, each of Jagdev and Sukhpal testified that they were never shareholders or directors of 0863846 BC Ltd. [28] In support of their submissions regarding a Sanderson order, the plaintiffs rely on Sohi v. Sohi , 2017 BCSC 720 [ Sohi ]. In an action with multiple defendants who were related family members, the Court in Sohi concluded that a Sanderson order was appropriate. As in this case, all of the respondents in Sohi were represented by the same counsel and did not raise individual defences to the action brought against them. The Court found that the impugned conduct, though insufficient to find liability against one of the defendants, was a “family effort” (at para. 85). The Court concluded that the successful defendant’s involvement with the unsuccessful defendant in the material events was sufficient to warrant granting a Sanderson order. [29] It is clear from the circumstances of this case that the plaintiffs believed that Prabhdev was acting in concert with Jagdev and Sukhpal in developing, subdividing and selling the Lands without regard to the Agreement to List. An action for inducing breach of contract is not limited to shareholders or directors of a company who breached the contract. Rather, any individual who may have induced such a breach may be named as a party. Although the evidence fell short of establishing such a claim against Jagdev and Sukhpal, it was reasonable and appropriate for the plaintiffs to have brought a claim against them. [30] Importantly, the preponderance of the evidence supports a finding that Prabhdev, by his tortious conduct intended to, and did benefit his brothers by circumventing the Agreement to List and having a different realtor market the homes on the subdivided Lands. It was Prabhdev’s actions that caused Jagdev and Sukphal to be brought into the litigation. In the circumstances of this case, this is sufficient to warrant granting a Sanderson order. [31] All things considered, I have concluded that it is fair and just to make a Sanderson order. The defendants, Jagdev and Sukhpal, will recover their costs of the action from the unsuccessful defendant, Prabhdev. [32] The burden is on the unsuccessful defendant to persuade the court why it should invoke its discretion to depart from the presumption that costs follow the event. One such exception relates to apportionment. [33] The Rule dealing with apportionment is Rule 14-1(15): Costs of whole or part of proceeding (15) The court may award costs (a) of a proceeding, (b) that relate to some particular application, step or matter in or related to the proceeding, or (c) except so far as they relate to some particular application, step or matter in or related to the proceeding and in awarding those costs the court may fix the amount of costs, including the amount of disbursements. [34] The defendants submit that plaintiff’s attempt to pierce the corporate veil, ought to be treated as a separate and discrete issue. The defendants successfully defended this aspect of the plaintiff’s claim. As I mentioned, the defendants submit that 15% of trial time ought to be allocated to this unsuccessful plea. [35] The plaintiffs counter with the submission that they were substantially successful at trial and should be awarded costs for the whole action. They contend that the evidence pertaining to issue of piercing of the corporate veil was interwoven with and overlapped with the evidence that would have been led by the plaintiffs even if they had not sought to impose personal liability upon the defendants for the defendant corporation’s breach of contract. [36] In Lewis v. Lehigh Northwest Cement Ltd. , 2009 BCCA 424, the Court of Appeal underscored that an order for apportionment of costs is exceptional and should be restricted to rare circumstances (at paras. 36-37). [37] The judicial test for apportionment of costs was formulated by the Court of Appeal in Sutherland v. Canada (Attorney General) , 2008 BCCA 27 at para. 31 [ Sutherland ], which dealt with Rule 57(15), the predecessor to Rule 14-1(15): (1) The party seeking apportionment must establish that there are separate and discrete issues upon which the ultimately unsuccessful party succeeded at trial; (2) there must be a basis on which the trial judge can identify the time attributable to the trial of these separate issues; (3) it must be shown that apportionment would effect a just result. [38] Given the substantially similar wording of the rules, the Sutherland principles are applicable to the court’s discretion under the new Rule 14-1(15): 0915406 BC Ltd. v. 0834618 BC Ltd. , 2013 BCSC 1529 at para. 7. [39] The defendants must establish all three constituent elements of the test to succeed in an apportionment of costs. On the third branch of the test, the Court in Sutherland stated that, if a party has prolonged the proceedings unnecessarily, this favours apportionment for the unnecessary time (at para. 33). A party who has raised an unnecessary issue, raised a spurious defence, or “over litigated” an issue properly raised by the other party may be found to have unnecessarily prolonged the proceedings (at para. 34). If the trial judge concludes that the evidence raised on this issue was irrelevant, this militates in favour of finding it was unnecessary (at para. 35). On the other hand, Mr. Justice Skolrood, in Liu v. Bourget , 2014 BCSC 1534 at para. 20, observed that, if the evidence is interwoven with the evidence going to other elements of the plaintiff’s case, it is not appropriate to divide the issues into discrete components for the purpose of apportioning costs. [40] This is not an exceptional case in which the issues considered by the Court were clearly discrete. In my view, the factual issues would have been substantially the same regardless of whether the plaintiffs had pursued a claim in relation to piercing the corporate veil. The evidence relating to piercing the corporate veil was interwoven with the evidence going to other elements of the plaintiffs’ case. It is not possible to divide the issues into discrete components for the purposes of apportioning costs. Even if I were able to identify the time attributable to the issue of piercing the corporate veil, I am not persuaded that dividing the issues into discrete components for purposes of an apportionment of costs would effect a just result. [41] Finally, I address the defendants’ submission that the plaintiff is not entitled to costs for the first three days of trial as the evidence did not relate to the claim for inducing breach of contract and were costs thrown away. I am not persuaded that there is merit to this submission. [42] The evidence led by the plaintiffs prior to the amendment application was relevant to proving the plaintiffs’ claim generally. The evidence on the formation of the contract served as the underpinning of my findings regarding the enforceability of the contract. This was a constituent element of proving the tort of inducing breach of contract. Moreover, the evidence pertaining to the interactions between the parties, the breach of the contract and Prabhdev’s conduct was also pertinent to proving the claim of inducing a breach of contract. [43] In short, I find that the plaintiffs were substantially successful in the action against Prabhdev and are therefore entitled to a costs award against him. [44] In the result, I order that the plaintiffs are entitled to their costs of the proceeding against Prabhdev, the unsuccessful defendant pursuant to Rule 14-1(9). Pursuant to my ruling on November 2, 2016, the defendants are entitled to costs against the plaintiff for one day of trial that related to the amendment application. Those costs will be set off from the costs for six days of trial that the plaintiffs are otherwise entitled to recover from Prabhdev. The net result is that the plaintiff is entitled to costs of the proceeding against Prabhdev, inclusive of five (and not seven) days of trial. [45] As this case was one of ordinary difficulty costs will be awarded at Scale B. [46] I order that the successful defendants, Jagdev and Sukhpal, are entitled to their costs of the action at Scale B. Pursuant to Rule 14-1(18), they must recover their costs against the unsuccessful defendant, Prabhdev. [47] The plaintiffs are entitled to the costs of this costs application. “Dardi J.”"},"meta":{},"created_at":"2022-03-10T01:19:20.467805Z","updated_at":"2022-03-10T01:19:20.467812Z","project":3},{"id":63,"annotations":[{"id":69,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"start":0,"end":36,"text":"COURT OF APPEAL FOR BRITISH COLUMBIA","labels":["COURT_NAME"]},"id":"40d40804-9","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":47,"end":78,"text":"Ma v.

Haniak , 2017 BCSC 549, New Westminster Dockets  M122025; M133802; M132800). The Appellants, appearing in person: Y. Ma H. Maung Counsel for the Respondents: J.R. Bradbury Place and Date of Hearing: Vancouver, British   Columbia December 21, 2018 Place and Date of Judgment: Vancouver, British   Columbia January 18, 2019   Written Reasons by: The Honourable Madam Justice Newbury   Summary: Application for order  removing three appeals from inactive list refused. Reasons for Judgment of the Honourable  Madam Justice Newbury: [1]     The three appeals that are the subject of this application for removal from  the inactive list pursuant to s. 25 of the  Court of Appeal Act ,  R.S.B.C. 1996, c. 77, were brought by the appellants Yin Yin Ma (“Ma”) and  her brother Mr. Maung from an order pronounced after trial by Mr. Justice  Armstrong in the Supreme Court of British Columbia on March 31, 2017. The trial  occupied 13 days in early 2016 and concerned three motor vehicle accidents in  which the appellants had been injured and in respect of which they claimed to  have suffered “incapacitating and permanent” injuries. Liability was admitted  in all three cases. For lengthy and detailed reasons indexed as 2017 BCSC 549,  the trial judge made adverse findings of credibility against both plaintiffs  and made awards that were considerably lower than those they had sought. The plaintiffs  were not represented by counsel at trial. [2]     The plaintiffs filed notices of appeal, without the participation of counsel,  on April 13, 2017. The notices state simply that the trial judgment contained  “errors and mistakes” that negatively affected the outcome of the case. [3]     It is unclear whether the plaintiffs were receiving the advice of legal  counsel in the spring of 2017; but on June 16, 2017, they were in chambers in  person before Madam Justice Garson seeking both an extension of time for the  filing of the appeal record, transcripts and factum, and an order permitting  the number of pages in their factum to be increased to 70. Madam Justice Garson  adjourned the applications for extensions of time and dismissed the application  to increase the length of the factum. In doing so, she expressed some concern  that the plaintiffs were wishing to have the case retried in this court. She  impressed upon them that the standard of review for findings of fact, including  findings of credibility, is that of “palpable and overriding” error. [4]     Immediately upon receiving Madam Justice Garson’s reasons, the plaintiffs  filed an application for the variation of her order. The parties (the  plaintiffs in person and the defendants represented by Mr. Bradbury)  appeared in chambers before Mr. Justice Harris on June 22, 2017. He  ordered that the time for filing the appeal record and the transcripts of oral  evidence be extended to July 14, 2017; that the time for filing the plaintiffs’  factum be extended to 30 days following the disposition of the application to  vary Madam Justice Garson’s order; and that that application be set for hearing  “no later than October of 2017 on a date convenient to counsel” for the  defendants. [5]     Notwithstanding the latter part of the order, the application to vary  was not heard until December 7, 2017, when the plaintiffs again appeared in  person and Mr. Bradbury appeared on behalf of the defendants before a  division of this court. The Chief Justice gave oral reasons for judgment on the  same date, stating in part:  While the trial judgment is long, and consolidates three  matters, the appellants do not point to more specific reasons as to why the  issues on appeal would be so complex as to take it outside the normal rule. The  fact that the judgment below was lengthy will not mean a lengthy factum is  required on appeal:  Sga’nism  at para. 11. The current limit already  takes into account that appeals may be reasonably complex. Nor did the  appellants provide a draft factum which would help this Court see why an  increase to the page limit should be granted. While such a draft factum is not  required, it is often useful to provide one:  Sga’nism  at para. 5. I  add, the beginnings of a draft factum were handed up by Ms. Ma in oral  submissions to us and we have had a chance to review that while we stood down.  It really does underline the concerns expressed by Justice Garson and confirms  her view of what is, indeed, prompting the requested length of the factum in  this case, and that is the desire to retry every issue of fact that was tried  before Justice Armstrong. I will say more of this after I have completed my  reasons. The chambers judge also properly  conceived the facts on the application. Her reasons indicate she was familiar  with the materials presented and the nature of the underlying appeal. While she  may have described the dispute as arising from a single motor vehicle accident,  a single sentence does not take away from the entirety of her reasons which  demonstrate she was aware of the factual and legal complexities of the appeal.  [At paras. 14-15.] In the result, the plaintiffs’ application was dismissed.  This meant that in accordance with the order of Mr. Justice Harris, the  factum was required to be filed no later than 30 days from December 7, 2017.  That deadline came and went without any such filing. [6]     From affidavit material filed on the present application, it appears  that at some time in March 2018, the plaintiffs retained Mr. P. Cote for  advice, although it is not clear whether that advice was limited to a review of  the plaintiffs’ appeal or also encompassed making all filings and appearances  in the Court on their behalf. (On November 20, 2017, another lawyer who had  carried out some filings for the plaintiffs in November 2017 filed a notice  that he was ceasing to act.)  [7]     On April 17, 2018, the Registrar wrote to the plaintiffs informing them  that their appeals had been placed on the inactive appeal list in accordance  with s. 25(1) of the  Court of Appeal Act . If no steps were taken,  the notices of appeal would stand dismissed as abandoned effective October 12,  2018. [8]     On October 11, 2018, Mr. Cote filed a notice of motion applying for  an order that the plaintiffs’ three appeals be removed from the inactive list.  The hearing of this application was rescheduled from November 15, 2018 to  December 21, 2018 by a “requisition” filed by the plaintiffs personally. The  plaintiffs wrote “by consent” in the requisition form, but as I understand it, Mr. Bradbury  consented only to the rescheduling and not to the granting of the actual  application to be made in chambers.  [9]     Mr. Cote did not appear in chambers and Ms. Ma advised me that  he had ceased acting for the plaintiffs because he was “too busy” and that the  plaintiffs would be seeking another lawyer in the new year, 2019. The  plaintiffs handed up to me an affidavit in which they describe their  difficulties dealing with various counsel during the past two years. It is  their view that both Mr. Cote and his predecessor “wasted significant  amount[s] of our time and our extremely limited financial resource[s]” and that  they have faced and continue to face “obstruction of justice since our access  to justice has been blocked since our basic human rights to legal assistance  and legal representation as Canadian citizens in face of serious legal matter  have been repeatedly denied throughout this [these] legal proceedings” in both  courts. [10]     The plaintiffs further claim to have been overwhelmed and “traumatized”  by the legal proceedings. They contend they did not receive a fair trial and  were “not allowed” to obtain legal assistance and representation at trial.  Further, they observe that the trial and other hearings had to be rescheduled  due to the death of their father in November 2014 from “so-called cancer” and  the death of their mother in February 2017 due to “so-called pneumonia”. They  depose:  Obviously, we do strongly believe  that these incidents could not be happening coincidentally. It is no doubt that  they are rather conspiracies and coincidences in order to block our access to  justice regarding our three MVAs cases. We do believe that we have been facing  surprise attacks (which absolutely cannot be strange coincidences) by the  deaths of our beloved father and mother each and every time we have to go to  the Court regarding our MVAs cases. [11]     The plaintiffs say they continue to face deliberate obstruction in the  form of the willful destruction of evidence from the trial, the trial  transcripts are missing, and again that they were “not allowed” to have legal  assistance at trial. They say they will not be able to write an effective factum  or represent themselves on their appeals without such assistance, and request  an extension of seven months in order to retain a lawyer who will prepare and  file a factum and appeal books. I have briefly reviewed Mr. Justice Armstrong’s  reasons and must say that I see nothing on their face to suggest that the  plaintiffs were disadvantaged or mistreated by reason of the fact they were unrepresented.  The judge appears to have carefully considered their arguments and evidence as  he would have if they had been provided by counsel at trial.  [12]     When I questioned Ms. Ma about the grounds of appeal that would be advanced  in their factum, she emphasized the conspiracy she alleges concerning the  coincidence of her parents’ respective deaths and scheduled court dates. Given  her answers to my questions, I believe it is reasonable to infer that neither  the plaintiffs nor any counsel retained by them has identified any possible  error of law or principle in the trial judge’s findings. Nor have they pointed  to any particular error of fact that they wish to challenge. They do not go  beyond the simple assertion in their notice of appeal that the trial judgment  “includes errors and mistakes.” Analysis [13]     It is well-known that the orders sought by the plaintiffs are  discretionary. The onus is on the applicants to show why the appeals should be  removed from the inactive list and that further time should be granted for the  filing of their factum and appeal record. The onus under s. 25 has been  said to be more onerous than the onus on an applicant for a simple extension of  time: see  Perren v. Lalari , 2009 BCCA 564. It seems to me that in this  case, the relevant factors to be considered include the possible merits of the  appeal, the length of delay that has occurred thus far and any likely future  delays, any prejudice to the defendants, and ultimately and most importantly,  whether the interests of justice support the granting of the order sought. [14]     In my view, they do not. It is now 21 months since the trial judge’s  order was pronounced and despite their efforts, the plaintiffs have been unable  to retain counsel who is willing to assist them in any substantive way. The plaintiffs  themselves acknowledge that they require counsel, but the affidavit material suggests  that they are unable to retain one, for whatever reason. Many people represent  themselves on appeals and do so successfully, but it would be extremely  difficult for the plaintiffs to succeed on their appeals, given the highly  factual nature of the trial judge’s reasons and his findings of credibility. The  plaintiffs have not provided this court with any evidence that would  demonstrate the incorrectness of any of those findings. Indeed, the plaintiffs’  new allegations concerning a connection between the deaths of their parents and  some conspiracy on the part of the defendants indicate to me that the  plaintiffs are desperately seeking grounds of appeal where there are none. Put  another way, the appeals appear to be without merit. [15]     As noted earlier, Madam Justice Garson informed the plaintiffs about the  nature of an appeal and what they must do and what they should have done in  2017 to get their appeal back on track. This did not happen. Although lawyers  have been retained, it appears none has lasted more than a few weeks. It is  unrealistic to believe that the plaintiffs will now be able to find another  lawyer who is ready, willing and able to act in accordance with the plaintiffs’  instructions. The defendants have not shown any particular prejudice that would  result from the orders sought, but the wasting of judicial resources on  meritless appeals is detrimental to the administration of justice. [16]     In all the circumstances, I am not convinced that the interests of justice  support the removal of the plaintiffs’ appeals from the inactive list. I would  therefore dismiss the application. “The Honourable Madam Justice Newbury”"},"meta":{},"created_at":"2022-03-10T01:19:20.467715Z","updated_at":"2022-03-10T01:19:20.467721Z","project":3},{"id":60,"annotations":[{"id":66,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"start":3,"end":40,"text":"THE SUPREME COURT OF BRITISH COLUMBIA","labels":["COURT_NAME"]},"id":"40d3e20a-9","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":51,"end":98,"text":"Drummond v.

Powell River (City),   2019 BCSC 92 Date: 20190108 Docket: S2707 Registry:  Powell River In  the Matter of an Application Pursuant to   Section 153 of the  Local Government Act Between: Allan Keith  Drummond Petitioner And City of Powell  River Respondent Before:  The Honourable Mr. Justice Groves Oral Reasons for Judgment   In  Chambers Counsel for the Petitioner: F.G. Reif Counsel for the Respondent: A. Carricato An interested party, appearing on his own behalf: George Doubt Place and Date of Trial\/Hearing: Vancouver, B.C. January 8, 2019 Place and Date of Judgment: Vancouver, B.C. January 8, 2019   [1]     THE COURT:  This is my decision on the matter of Allan Keith  Drummond and the City of Powell River. [2]     In this petition filed pursuant to the  Local Government Act , R.S.B.C.  2015, c. 1, the petitioner applies by way of petition for the following  relief, namely an order that the official results regarding two candidates,  being Allan Drummond and George Doubt, in the civic election held in Powell  River on the 20th of October, 2018, be declared invalid and that the election  of the city councillor George Doubt be annulled. Further, it seeks a  declaration that the chief electoral officer of the City of Powell River  declare the results of the election invalid. [3]     As indicated in the prayers for relief, municipal elections were held in  the City of Powell River, as they were throughout the province, on the 20th of  October, 2018. Specifically in Powell River, the municipal election was for,  amongst other things, the position of mayor and six positions as city  councillor. As a result of the election on that date, the sixth place council  position was awarded to George Doubt, who is an interested party who appeared  on this matter. Mr. Doubt, in the official results of the municipal election in  the City of Powell River, received 1,766 votes. [4]     I should add here that Mr. Doubt, as an interested party, spoke and  provided articulate reasons for his view as to why the petition should not be  granted. [5]     The seventh place result holder after the October 20, 2018 municipal  election was Allan Keith Drummond, the petitioner. Mr. Drummond received 1,764  votes, or two votes less than Mr. Doubt.  [6]     After the results of this very close election were made public, it  appears from the evidence before me that the CEO of the City of Powell River  did a sample audit of some sort, which did not result in any concerns being  raised. [7]     The petitioner, Allan Keith Drummond, did his own internal investigation  and analysis of those persons who cast votes in the election. The petitioner  states in the petition that he uncovered, through this analysis, six persons  who indicated a civic address to vote on their voter registration which was  outside the municipal boundaries of the City of Powell River, making them, in  his view, ineligible to vote. It is not disputed by anyone that, in fact, there  are six people who have indicated in their voter registration an address  outside the City of Powell River, and that they in fact voted. They gave on  their registration a residential address outside of the boundaries of Powell  River. [8]     But being a resident is not the only basis on which a person is entitled  to vote. In fact, subsequent investigation by the CEO of the City of Powell  River determined, it appears, that two of those six people who listed addresses  outside of the municipal boundaries of Powell River, were in fact owners of  real property or land within the City of Powell River and, as such, were  eligible to vote. That left four people who voted who the petitioner claims  were  prima facie  not eligible to vote. [9]     I should have said earlier, but will say here, that it is my  understanding that in order to be able to vote in a municipal election, you  have to have achieved the age of majority, you have to be a Canadian citizen,  you have to reside in a municipal address within the boundaries of the  municipality for a prescribed period of time, or, if you do not reside within  the municipality but meet the other criteria, and you own real property within  the municipality, as such being a land tax payer, you are entitled to vote in  municipal elections. [10]     It is fair to say, as well, that the CEO of Powell River and the chief  electoral officer have not advanced any evidence to dispute the factual  assertion made by the petitioner that, in fact, four people who were not  eligible to vote in fact did. [11]     I am, as such, satisfied on a balance of probabilities that in the  municipal election in Powell River on the 20th of October 2018 that four people  voted who were not entitled to vote. Of course, how or why those people voted  or who those people are remains an open question, but the reality is that four  people voted who were not entitled. [12]     The  Local Government Act  is the piece of legislation which  governs the affairs of most municipalities in British Columbia. The  Local  Government Act , in Part 3, deals with the provisions for voting and  specifically for setting aside a vote. [13]     The relevant section under the section of \"Declaration of Invalid Election\",  s. 153(5)(b) reads: (5) An application may be made only on one or more of the  following bases: . . . (b) that an election should be declared invalid because it  was not conducted in accordance with this Act or a regulation or bylaw under  this Act; [14]     That is the basis on which Mr. Drummond makes his application and files  his petition before the court. [15]     His basis for saying that the election was not conducted or was not in  accordance with the  Act  is, of course, his assertion, which I accept, on  a balance of probabilities, that four persons who were not eligible to vote in  fact did. [16]     Additionally, the powers of the court on this type of application are  set out in s. 155 of the  Local Government Act . Section 155(2) reads  as follows: (2) On the hearing of an application under section 153  regarding the validity of an election, the court may . . . (c) declare that the election of a candidate is invalid and  that the office is vacant . . . [17]     Additionally, germane to my decision today is s. 155(3) of the  Local  Government Act  which reads as follows: (3) The court must not declare an election invalid by reason  only of an irregularity or failure to comply with this Act or a regulation or  bylaw under this Act if the court is satisfied that (a) the election was conducted in good faith and in  accordance with the principles of this Act, and (b) the irregularity or failure did not materially affect  the result of the election. [18]     I should say here that I am satisfied that everyone involved in the  electoral process in Powell River on the 20th of October, 2018, acted in good  faith. There is no suggestion of a purposeful or wilful intent to contravene  the  Act . It would appear that the poll workers accepted declarations  from these four people that they were eligible to vote, as the poll workers  should have. Unfortunately, these people, the four people in question, likely  thought that they were eligible to vote, but as it turns out they were not, on  the evidence before me. [19]     As an aside, future avoidance of this problem may be solved if poll  workers are instructed to cross check addresses noted on voter registrations  with civic addresses within the municipal boundaries. [20]     Now, having found that the election was conducted in good faith in  accordance with the principles of the  Act , having found essentially that  there was no bad faith, that there was no intentional inappropriate voting, the  issue becomes whether or not the irregularity or failure materially affected  the result of the election. [21]     That issue has been canvassed relatively recently by the Supreme Court  of Canada in the case of  Opitz v. Wrzesnewskyj , 2012 SCC 55. The facts  in that case involved a federal election of, I believe, 2010. There is a  factual dispute between the majority and the minority as to how many irregular  votes there were. The two candidates, Mr. Opitz, the successful candidate, and Mr.  Wrzesnewskyj, the unsuccessful candidate, were separated after final tallies by  26 votes. It was suggested that there were 79 irregular votes cast. The  majority found there only to be 20 irregular votes and upheld the election. The  dissent found there to be 79 irregular votes and would have ordered a new  election. [22]     However, despite this factual determination, my reading of the case is  that both the majority and the minority accepted the following test as an  applicable test as to when the courts should step in and declare an election to  be invalid. Reading a summary from the headnote on page 8 of 79 of that  decision, the Supreme Court of Canada notes the following: Votes cast by persons not  entitled to vote are irregularities that can affect the result of the election,  because they are votes that should not have been cast. If the number of such  votes equals or exceeds the winner’s plurality, then the result of the election  is affected and the election should be annulled. [23]     It goes without saying that judges of the B.C. Supreme Court are bound  by decisions of the Supreme Court of Canada. Though the federal election law  related to federal elections is different than that of the  Local Government  Act , the principles are the same. The principles being that if the  irregularities are such that they would affect the result of an election, it is  appropriate that the election be annulled. [24]     I do not know how these four people who voted, who should not have  voted, cast their votes. There is no way to know that. Mr. Doubt has suggested  to the court that there are many circumstances as to how these people could  have voted, circumstances being of course that they could have voted for both Mr.  Doubt and Mr. Drummond. They could have voted for neither Mr. Drummond nor Mr. Doubt.  They could have voted all for Mr. Drummond, all for Mr. Doubt, in any  combination which adds up to four. But that is not something that is ever  discernible. [25]     All I can say, having accepted the facts that I do accept, is that four  people voted who were not entitled to vote, and the results between Mr. Doubt  and Mr. Drummond is only two votes. [26]     As such, I have to conclude that the irregularity may have affected the  result of the election and it is incumbent upon me, pursuant to the direction  of the Supreme Court of Canada in  Opitz , to declare the election to be  annulled. I make such a declaration. The position of sixth city councillor in  Powell River is, as such and as of today's date, vacant and it is incumbent  upon the City of Powell River to make a determination pursuant to the  Local  Government Act  as to whether or not a municipal by‑election need be  held. I do not have information on that. I am sure they are required to do it,  but that is up to them. [27]     All right, thank you. [28]     MR. REIF: I've got some submissions to make on costs. [29]     THE COURT: Go ahead. [SUBMISSIONS RE COSTS FROM 2:18:40 P.M. TO 2:24:09 P.M.] [30]     THE COURT: All right. I have reviewed the bill of costs of Mr. Drummond.  I am satisfied that, in regards to Item Number 1, three units should be allowed.  Item Number 2, five units should be allowed. Item Number 6, three units should  be allowed. The rest are all required units. That means he is entitled to 39  units. That is $4,290; $480.48 in taxes; for a total of $4,770.48, plus $929.05  for disbursements, all of which are reasonable, for a total of $5,699.53. I  will give the City of Powell River 30 days to pay those costs. “Groves  J.”"},"meta":{},"created_at":"2022-03-10T01:19:20.467515Z","updated_at":"2022-03-10T01:19:20.467521Z","project":3},{"id":58,"annotations":[{"id":64,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"start":3,"end":40,"text":"THE SUPREME COURT OF BRITISH COLUMBIA","labels":["COURT_NAME"]},"id":"40d3e1d5-9","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":51,"end":97,"text":"Bryce v.

Rala Investments Ltd.,   2020 BCSC 51 Date: 20200114 Docket: S184679 Registry:  New Westminster Between: John Peter Bryce Plaintiff And Rala Investments  Ltd. and Allan Sadler Defendants Corrected  Oral Ruling: The cover page of the Oral Ruling was corrected on   January 16, 2020 Before:  The Honourable Mr. Justice G.C. Weatherill Oral Ruling re: Admissibility of the Expert Report of  John Ribalkin Counsel for the Plaintiff: T.J. Hewitt    B. Goertz, Articled Student Counsel for the Defendants: A.   Dhinsa    J. McGreevy Place and Dates of Submissions during trial: New Westminster, B.C. January 13–14, 2020 Place and Date of Ruling: New Westminster, B.C. January 14, 2020   [1]     The defendants apply, during the course of the trial of this action, for  a ruling that an expert report the plaintiff proposes to tender in evidence is  inadmissible. [2]     The plaintiff claims damages for the professional negligence of the  defendant mortgage broker and its principal who he alleges provided him with a  property appraisal upon which he relied to provide third mortgage property  financing. The property was subsequently foreclosed. The plaintiff says he  never would have loaned the moneys but for the appraisal and alleges that he  lost approximately $202,000 as a result. [3]     The appraisal in issue is dated February 2, 2012 and was prepared by a  company called Canadian Home Appraisals. It was not for the plaintiff but  rather for an entity called Verico Select Mortgages (“Verico”) and its  principal J. McLean. Although I have yet to hear evidence on the point, I  assume that Verico was an unrelated prospective private mortgage financing firm  and J. McLean was a principal at Verico. A copy of the appraisal was obtained  by the defendants (I believe from an independent mortgage brokerage firm called  “Canadian Mortgage Strategies & Investments” although I have yet to be  provided with any confirmatory evidence) and was provided by the defendants to  the plaintiff on April 5, 2012, approximately five weeks prior to him advancing  the third mortgage financing in question. [4]     The parties are in agreement that the appraisal valued the property  significantly higher than its actual market value at the time and that, for the  purpose of trial, was prepared negligently. The plaintiff originally named  Canadian Home Appraisals, its principal, Jeff Pokoroka, and the author of the  appraisal, Kevin Janzen, as defendants. However, the action was discontinued  against them because it was determined by plaintiff’s counsel that the limit of  liability and waiver language contained in the appraisal precluded an action  against them. [5]     Fundamental to the plaintiff’s case against the remaining defendants,  namely the mortgage brokerage firm and its principal, is the assertion that  they breached the standard of care expected of them in the circumstances. In  particular, the plaintiff alleges that the defendants had a duty to and failed: a)   to recommend  that the plaintiff obtain his own appraisal of the property before providing  mortgage financing; and\/or b)   failed to advise  the plaintiff to obtain what is called a Letter of Transmittal from the author  of the appraisal before using and relying upon it. [6]     The plaintiff served and proposes to rely at trial upon the expert  report of John Ribalkin, an experienced mortgage broker. While the defendants  do not object to Mr. Ribalkin’s qualifications and experience, they do object  to the admissibility of the report itself. Their principle objection is that  the opinions Mr. Ribalkin purports to express are an attempt to usurp the  function of the trial judge. [7]     I have read Mr. Ribalkin’s report which, excluding its voluminous  attachments, is a relatively short 4 pages. [8]     Mr. Ribalkin begins his report by properly setting out his duty under  Rule 11-2 of the  Supreme Court Civil Rules , followed by a listing of the  documents he was provided by plaintiff’s counsel and upon which he has relied  for his report. He then exhibits and comments upon various information  bulletins published online by the British Columbia Financial Institutions  Commission Registrar of Mortgage Brokers that were in existence at the relevant  time as support for his opinion regarding a mortgage broker’s duty of care when  supplying a property appraisal to a potential investor. The Financial  Institutions Commission administers the  Mortgage Brokers Act  of British  Columbia, R.S.B.C. 1996, c. 313 [ Act ]. Mr. Ribalkin also refers to  various regulations passed under the  Act . [9]     After reading the definition of “Sophisticated Person” as set out in the  regulations, Mr. Ribalkin opines that the plaintiff “is not in my opinion a  ‘Sophisticated Person’ as defined in these regulations”. [10]     After then stating and\/or interpreting various provisions of the  Act   regarding the statutory duties owed by mortgage brokers, Mr. Ribalkin states  that “In this mortgage transaction ‘Sadler’ in my opinion was acting on behalf  of ‘Bryce’”. [11]     Then, having read on the face of the appraisal that it had been  addressed to Verico–J. McLean, Mr. Ribalkin states that “…therefore ‘McLean’  was the only party that could rely on this appraisal”. He goes on to state  that: For another party or lender to  rely on this appraisal then a Letter of Transmittal (hereinafter referred to as  “LOT”) has to be obtained from the appraisal firm so that the lender, in this  case “Bryce”, is then by the “LOT” has [sic] gained ownership of the report and  can then rely on it to make a lending decision. Without a “LOT” this  [appraisal] has no value to “Bryce” whatsoever. [12]     Mr. Ribalkin states that the defendants “should have advised “Bryce”  that to rely on that appraisal report that [ sic ] a “LOT” would have to  be obtained or “Bryce” would have to procure another appraisal addressed  directly to him that he could rely on for lending purposes”. [13]     Mr. Ribalkin then states: I have read through all the documents as supplied to me by  [plaintiff’s counsel] and I see no declaration from “Sadler” to “Bryce” that he  should obtain a “LOT” to be able to rely on the appraisal… This is a basic  standard of care that a Mortgage Broker should do for a lender.  [Emphasis  added.] (the “Standard of Care Opinion”). [14]     Mr. Ribalkin then pontificates about how best a lender can recover an  investment in the case of default, including through the means of foreclosure  or Errors and Omissions Insurance that “all appraisal companies and their  employees carry to cover their work”. [15]     Finally, Mr. Ribalkin states that: Seeing no “LOT”, seeing no  declaration from “Sadler” to “Bryce” that without the “LOT” or a new appraisal  the appraisal that was included in the [Investor\/Lender Disclosure Statement]  prepared by “Sadler” had no value to “Bryce”. In my opinion, “Sadler” by not  obtaining a “LOT” for the lender or advising the lender to obtain his own “LOT”  or advising the lender to obtain a new appraisal he could rely upon failed in  his Duty of Care to “Bryce”. [16]     The role of an expert is to assist the court by providing an impartial  and objective opinion on matters outside the experience and knowledge of the  trier of fact:  Royce Holdings Inc. v. Jupe , 2018 BCSC 2025 at para. 81. [17]     It is not the function of an expert in court proceedings to simply  regurgitate plain language he or she has read in text books, periodicals or, as  in this case, in a statute and regulations and related bulletins, and them  simply opine on the outcome of a case based upon those readings. Such  postulations are neither necessary nor relevant. The court is fully capable of  reading and understanding such passages. [18]     It is even more improper for an expert to usurp the function of the  court in a negligence case by opining that a party has breached a duty of  care. That is for the trier of fact to determine, not an expert. [19]     Mr. Ribalkin’s report is flawed in all of these respects. [20]     As was stated by this court in  CMC Engineering and Management Limited  v. Pinnacle Renewable Energy Inc. , 2018 BCSC 2457 at para. 13(g), in  exercising my gatekeeping function, I may take into account that I am sitting  without a jury and am able to disregard shortcomings in the phrasing of the  expert report that might be problematic if the trier of fact was a jury. [21]     I find that Mr. Ribalkin’s report is admissible to the extent that it  provides an opinion as to the standard of care expected of a mortgage broker by  the industry in the circumstances of this case. The only place in his report  that he does so is in the passage quoted at para. 13 above. However, I am  satisfied that, in exercising my gatekeeping function, I am able to disregard  the shortcomings in phraseology used by Mr. Ribalkin in the final sentence of  his report and give his opinion set out in that sentence the appropriate weight  on the basis and only on the basis that the sentence is amended to read as  follows, which I find is effectively what Mr. Ribalkin was attempting to  convey: In my opinion, before making use of an appraisal prepared for  a third party, it was standard practice in the mortgage brokerage industry for  a mortgage broker to first: (a)     obtain an “LOT”; (b)     advise the lender to obtain an “LOT”; or (c)     advise the lender to obtain his own appraisal. [22]     The balance of the opinions set out in the report are inadmissible.   Specifically, the portions of the report from the last paragraph at the bottom  of page 2 to the end of the report are inadmissible with the exception of the  Standard of Care Opinion and the final sentence as I have reformulated it. “G.C.

Clavier Place and Date of Hearing: Vancouver, British   Columbia January 20, 2020 Place and Date of Judgment: Vancouver, British   Columbia January 22, 2020   Summary: The appellant seeks leave to  appeal an interim order granting the respondents contact time with his  children, who are their grandchildren. Held: Application dismissed. The  appellant has not shown that the disposition of this appeal would affect the  upcoming trial of this matter in any substantive way. Consequently, it is not  in the interests of justice for the appeal to proceed. [1]     GARSON J.A. : This is an application for leave to appeal an  interim order of the Supreme Court of British Columbia granting the respondents  contact with their grandchildren, pursuant to the provisions of the  Family  Law Act , S.B.C. 2011, c. 25 [ FLA ]. The application turns on  whether it is in the interests of justice to grant leave to appeal.  [2]     For the reasons given below, I have concluded that it is not in the  interests of justice to grant leave to appeal. As a result, the appellant’s  application is dismissed. [3]     The appellant, Scott Delbeck, is the father of two children (the  “children”). The respondents, Cecilia and Ronald Gill (the “Gills”), are the  maternal grandparents of the children. [4]     The children’s mother died in November 2016. At that time, she and Mr. Delbeck  had been separated for approximately one year. The Gills were very involved in  the children’s lives before and for some time after their mother’s death.  [5]     In March 2017, Mr. Delbeck stopped allowing the Gills to have  contact with the children. In May 2017, the Gills filed a notice of family  claim in which they sought an order for contact. [6]     In August 2017, Mr. Delbeck advised the Gills that he planned to  move with the children to Denver for work purposes. That move occurred on  November 8, 2017. [7]     Before the Delbecks moved to Denver, two interim orders were made  respecting contact: one by consent at a judicial case conference on August 24,  2017, and the other following a contested application on November 3, 2017.  Those orders provided for periodic in‑person contact and regular contact  via Skype through the summer of 2018. The parties agreed to a further in‑person  visit in January 2019. [8]     On June 13, 2019, the Gills filed a notice of application seeking a  further interim order for contact. At the time the application was filed, the  children were living in Denver and were not physically present in British Columbia. [9]     In reasons indexed at 2019 BCSC 1660, Justice Fleming found that she had  jurisdiction to order contact under s. 74(2) of the  FLA . That  section provides: (2)  Despite any other provision of this Part,  a court  may make an order under this Part respecting guardianship, parenting  arrangements or contact with a child only if one of the following conditions is  met : (a)  the child is habitually resident in British Columbia  when the application is filed; (b)  the child is not habitually resident in British  Columbia when the application is filed, but the court is satisfied that (i)  the child is  physically present in British Columbia when the application is filed , (ii)  substantial  evidence concerning the best interests of the child is available in British Columbia, (iii)  no  application for an extraprovincial order is pending before an extraprovincial  tribunal in a place where the child is habitually resident, (iv)  no  extraprovincial order has been recognized by a court in British Columbia, (v)  the  child has a real and substantial connection with British Columbia, and (vi)  on  the balance of convenience, it is appropriate for jurisdiction to be exercised  in British Columbia; (c)  the child is physically present in British Columbia  and the court is satisfied that the child would suffer serious harm if the  child were to (i)  remain with, or be  returned to, the child's guardian, or (ii)  be  removed from British Columbia. [Emphasis added.] [10]     The chambers judge held that for the purposes of s. 74(2), an  “application is filed” when the “document that commences the claim for  guardianship, parenting arrangement[s] or contact is filed; in this case, the  notice of family claim”: at para. 10. She determined that because the  children lived in the jurisdiction at the time the notice of family claim was  filed, the court was entitled to make an interim order respecting contact. [11]     The chambers judge further concluded that an order for contact was  appropriate in this case. She made an order that allowed the Gills to exercise  in‑person contact for four days in Colorado during the children’s  2019–2020 winter break and for ten days in Vancouver during the children’s 2020  summer break. The order also provided for weekly 15‑minute Skype calls. [12]     Mr. Delbeck seeks leave to appeal the chambers judge’s order. He  alleges that she erred in her interpretation of s. 74(2) of the  FLA   and was without jurisdiction to make an interim order for contact when the  children resided in Denver. He says the word “application” in s. 74(2)(b)  refers to the notice of application that is the actual notice seeking the  interim order, filed, in this case, long after the children had moved to  Denver, not the initiating pleading that commenced the family claim.  Accordingly, he says the chambers judge lacked jurisdiction to make an order  under s. 74(2)(b) because the children were not physically present in  British Columbia when the application was filed. [13]     The Gills say there is no merit to the appeal and no merit to the  application for leave. In particular, they say there is no utility to the  parties in this appeal because the jurisdictional question will not arise at  the trial and, therefore, the appeal will have little impact on the child care  arrangements. [14]     The trial of the action is set to proceed in September 2020. [15]     An appeal to the Court does not lie from a limited appeal order without  the leave of a justice:  Court of Appeal Act , R.S.B.C. 1996, c. 77,  s. 7(2). Orders granting interim relief under the  FLA  are limited  appeal orders:  Court of Appeal Rules , R. 2.1(c). [16]     In  Goldman, Sachs & Co. v. Sessions , 2000 BCCA 326 at para. 10  (Chambers), Justice Saunders explained that the criteria for granting leave to  appeal include: [1]   whether  the point on appeal is of significance to the practice; [2] whether the point raised is of significance to the  action itself; [3] whether  the appeal is prima facie meritorious or, on the other hand, whether it is  frivolous; and [4] whether the appeal  will unduly hinder the progress of the action. [17]     The criteria for leave are “all considered under the rubric of  the interests of justice”:  Vancouver (City) v. Zhang , 2007 BCCA 280 at para. 10  (Chambers). Even where the four criteria listed above are met, leave may be  denied if it would not be in the interests of justice for the appeal to  proceed:  Movassaghi v. Aghtai,  2010 BCCA 175 at para. 27 (Chambers). [18]     The party seeking leave to appeal bears the onus of establishing that  the test for leave has been met:  B.C. Teachers’ Federation v. B.C. (Attorney  General)  (1986), 4 B.C.L.R. (2d) 8 (C.A.) at 11 (Chambers).  [19]     In oral argument, counsel for Mr. Delbeck did not contest the  Gills’ submission that the outcome of the appeal is irrelevant to the ultimate  disposition of this action. Consequently, I accept that characterization is  accurate. As I have said, the trial is to determine the final order and the  relevant pleading is the originating family claim. Accordingly, the question of  jurisdiction that Mr. Delbeck says arises on the interim application will  not arise in the trial. [20]     The sole effect of this appeal as it relates to the parties themselves  would be to determine whether the Gills are entitled to the interim contact.  That contact includes one ten‑day visit over the summer holidays and  weekly Skype calls. Depending on the timing of the appeal, reasons may or may  not be available prior to the summer visit. [21]     As stated in  Munro v. Munro , 2015 BCCA 530 at para. 18  (Chambers), the “values of efficiency and proportionality are relevant to the  interests of justice.” The question is whether the potential benefit of a  successful appeal justifies the expense that both parties will incur if it  proceeds, given that the appeal will have no effect on the final order made at  trial. In my view, it does not. [22]     Mr. Delbeck’s proposed ground of appeal is arguable and may be of  importance to the practice. However, in this case, and for these parties, the  interests of justice favours resolution by trial without an intervening and  costly appeal, particularly where the trial is only eight months away.  Moreover, as I have said, the appeal is only relevant to the interim order and  will not advance the disposition of the underlying dispute. [23]     For these reasons, I dismiss the application for leave to appeal with  costs. “The  Honourable Madam Justice Garson”"},"meta":{},"created_at":"2022-03-10T01:19:20.467330Z","updated_at":"2022-03-10T01:19:20.467337Z","project":3},{"id":56,"annotations":[{"id":62,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"start":0,"end":36,"text":"COURT OF APPEAL FOR BRITISH COLUMBIA","labels":["COURT_NAME"]},"id":"40d3b9ea-9","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":47,"end":73,"text":"R. v.

Edge,   2021 BCCA 35 Date: 20210127 Docket: CA46315 Between: Regina Respondent And Peter Matthew Edge Appellant Before: The Honourable Mr. Justice Abrioux The Honourable Mr. Justice Grauer The Honourable Mr. Justice Voith On appeal from: An  order of the Supreme Court of British Columbia, dated   May 22, 2019 (conviction) and July 18, 2019 (sentence)   ( R. v. Edge , 2019 BCSC 1388, Vancouver Docket 27198-14).  The Appellant, appearing in person (via teleconference): P.M. Edge Counsel for the Respondent (via teleconference): S. Gillespie Place and Date of Hearing: Vancouver, British   Columbia January 18, 2021 Place and Date of Judgment: Vancouver, British   Columbia January 27, 2021   Written Reasons by: The Honourable Mr. Justice Abrioux Concurred in by: The Honourable Mr. Justice Grauer The Honourable Mr. Justice Voith   Summary: In 2019 the appellant was  convicted of criminal harassment and uttering threats, and sentenced to 18  months’ imprisonment (reduced to time served) and a three-year term of  probation. He applied to the Legal Services Society to fund an appeal. This was  denied for reasons other than financial ineligibility. He subsequently  initiated an appeal and, in June 2020, applied for court-appointed counsel  pursuant to s. 684 of the Criminal Code. His application was dismissed on  the basis that there was no merit to the appeal. He failed to attend two case  management hearings. The Associate Registrar then referred the matter to a  justice pursuant to Rule 13(3) of the Criminal Appeal Rules. The appellant  again failed to appear, and the justice referred the matter to a division of  the Court to consider whether to dismiss the appeal for want of prosecution. Held:  Appeal dismissed for want of prosecution. The appellant has not taken the  required steps to advance his appeal since his s. 684 application was  dismissed, nor indicated any intention to do so. He has not provided a  reasonable explanation for his inaction.  Reasons for Judgment of the Honourable  Mr. Justice Abrioux: [1]     This matter concerns a reference to the Court pursuant to Rule 13(3)  of the  British Columbia   Court of Appeal Criminal Appeal Rules, 1986,  B.C.  Reg. 145\/86 [ Criminal Appeal Rules ]   whereby an order is  sought dismissing Mr. Edge’s conviction and sentence appeals for want of  prosecution.  [2]     I will set out the pertinent background and appearances in this Court. [3]     On May 22, 2019, Justice Devlin (sitting with a jury) convicted the  appellant, who was self-represented at his trial, of criminal harassment of his  then-spouse, as well as uttering threats to cause death or bodily harm both to his  then-spouse and to his mother. On July 18, 2019, Devlin J. sentenced the  appellant to a total of 18 months’ imprisonment (reduced to time served  due to extensive pre-trial custody) and a three-year term of probation. [4]     Following the imposition of sentence, the appellant applied to the Legal  Services Society (“LSS”) to fund his appeal. By letter dated June 25,  2020, the LSS denied the appellant’s application for reasons other than  financial ineligibility. [5]     On August 19, 2019, Mr. Edge initiated an appeal in this Court  by filing a Notice of Appeal in which he alleged multiple grounds of appeal regarding  both conviction and sentence which include: ·     the inherent unfairness of proceeding to trial while he was unrepresented,  which rendered the trial itself invalid such that a new trial is required; and ·     ancillary grounds of appeal alleging malfeasance by various  justice system participants, including the police, Crown Counsel, and the trial  judge. [6]     On June 9, 2020, pursuant to s. 684 of the  Criminal Code ,  R.S.C. 1985, c. C‑46, the appellant applied for counsel to be  appointed to represent him on the appeal. On July 24, 2020, his  application was dismissed in Chambers by Justice Dickson, on the basis that  there was no merit to his appeal. [7]     Following the dismissal of his s. 684 application, a case  management hearing was scheduled by teleconference for September 25, 2020.  Crown counsel attended, the appellant did not and the Court was unable to reach  him via telephone. By letter dated September 29, 2020, Crown counsel  advised Mr. Edge of the missed case management hearing and informed him of  the next appearance date, being a case management hearing scheduled for November 2,  2020. [8]     The appellant did not attend at that hearing. By letter dated November 3,  2020, Crown counsel advised Mr. Edge that no further appearances would be  scheduled until he took some action to proceed with his appeal, and should this  not occur by December 3, 2020, his appeal could be dismissed pursuant to  Rule 13(3) of the  Criminal Appeal Rules . [9]     By letter dated November 4, 2020, the Associate Registrar advised  the appellant that pursuant to Rule 13(3) of the  Criminal Appeal Rules , a  hearing date had been scheduled for December 3, 2020 at which time it  would be decided whether the appeal would be referred to the Court to be  dismissed. The appellant was provided with the requisite information to attend  the hearing by telephone. [10]     The appellant did not attend the December 3, 2020 hearing. Justice  Tysoe then referred the matter to proceed before a division of the Court to  consider whether the appeal should be dismissed for want of prosecution.  [11]     By letter dated December 3, 2020, Crown Counsel advised Mr. Edge  that if he declined to take further action, his appeal “may be dismissed for  want of prosecution pursuant to Rule 13 of the  Criminal Appeal Rules” .   Crown Counsel also attempted to contact the appellant by telephone on  December 4, 2020, but was unable to reach him. [12]     By letter dated December 24, 2020, the Associate Registrar advised  the appellant that a referral to a division of the Court to consider dismissing  the appeal had been set for Monday, January 18, 2021 at 10:00 a.m. The  appellant was provided with the requisite information to attend the hearing by  telephone together with a Notice of Abandonment form should he wish to abandon  the appeal. [13]     The appellant appeared at the teleconference of January 18, 2021. [14]     The Crown’s position was that the appellant had, as of January 18, 2021,  taken no action to move forward with his appeal since his s. 684  application was dismissed. He had not contacted the Crown nor the Registry to  indicate that he wished to proceed with his appeal. [15]     The Crown also pointed to the fact that Mr. Edge was provided with  notice of the case management conferences of September 25, 2020 and  November 2, 2020, and the December 3, 2020 hearing, and did not  attend on any of those occasions. [16]     The appellant’s position was that he was unable and unwilling to  represent himself on the appeal. He argued that the Court had a responsibility to  instruct the LSS to provide him with legal counsel; if it did not do so then  the appeal “will have to wait”, even if it might take “a long time”. He also  explained that his failure to move the appeal forward flowed from his  unemployment and lack of funds to order transcripts or take other steps in the  process. In that regard he says that there was no point in attending the  teleconferences and\/or the hearing of December 3, 2020 since he did not  have counsel. [17]     The appellant has not taken the required steps to advance his appeal.  His s. 684 application was dismissed more than five months ago, and in the  intervening time he has neither filed the outstanding appeal materials nor  indicated any interest in pursuing his appeal in any practical way.  [18]     In light of the appellant’s submissions, it must be emphasized that on  July 24, 2020, following an analysis of the alleged grounds of appeal of  both conviction and sentence, the s. 684 application was dismissed on the  basis that there was no merit to either appeal and the appointment of counsel  was not in the interests of justice. [19]     It is evident from the appellant’s submissions that he has no plan to do  what is required to move the appeal forward. In my view he has also not provided  a reasonable explanation for what I consider to be a lengthy period of inaction,  which includes his failure to attend the teleconference hearings of September 25,  2020, November 2, 2020 and December 3, 2020. [20]     I would dismiss both the conviction appeal and the application for leave  to appeal sentence for want of prosecution. “The Honourable Mr. Justice  Abrioux” I AGREE: “The  Honourable Mr. Justice Grauer” I AGREE: “The  Honourable Mr. Justice Voith”"},"meta":{},"created_at":"2022-03-10T01:19:20.467271Z","updated_at":"2022-03-10T01:19:20.467278Z","project":3},{"id":54,"annotations":[{"id":60,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"start":0,"end":36,"text":"COURT OF APPEAL FOR BRITISH COLUMBIA","labels":["COURT_NAME"]},"id":"40d36ca7-9","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":47,"end":102,"text":"Ahmed v.

Canna Clinic Medicinal Society,   2019 BCCA 44 Date: 20190116 Docket: CA45263 Between: Jutta Ahmed Appellant (Plaintiff) And Canna Clinic  Medicinal Society Respondent (Defendant) Before: The Honourable Mr. Justice Harris The Honourable Madam Justice Stromberg-Stein The Honourable Madam Justice Fenlon On appeal from: An  order of the Supreme Court of British Columbia, dated   April 6, 2018 ( Ahmed v. Cannaclinic Medicinal Society , Vancouver Docket  S182842). Oral Reasons for Judgment The Appellant, appearing in person: J. Ahmed    with M. Ahmed Counsel for the Respondent: A. Sodagar Place and Date of Hearing: Vancouver, British   Columbia January 16, 2019 Place and Date of Judgment: Vancouver, British   Columbia January 16, 2019   Summary: Ms. Ahmed appeals an  order dismissing her petition for judicial review of a Provincial Court  decision and awarding special costs against her. Held: appeal allowed in part.  The chambers judge did not err by exercising his discretion to dismiss Ms. Ahmed’s  petition for judicial review based on her delay and the repetition of issues  raised and decided in previous court proceedings. However, the judge’s order  awarding special costs against Ms. Ahmed is not supported by the reasons  for judgment, and accordingly must be set aside. [1]     FENLON J.A. : Ms. Ahmed is self-represented, although her  husband, Mohamed Ahmed, speaks on her behalf in court proceedings as he did  today. Ms. Ahmed says that the judge’s decision not to allow her to  proceed with a judicial review of the Small Claims Court decision and ordering  special costs against her shows he was not exercising his discretion  reasonably, and did not understand that there is no time limit on a judicial  review. [2]     The dispute between Ms. Ahmed and the respondent Canna Clinic  Medicinal Society (“Canna Clinic”) has been long and fractious. Canna Clinic  leased premises Ms. Ahmed owns on Granville Street in Vancouver. The  leases started in March and September 2014 for three-year terms. Things got off  to a rocky start immediately as the landlord understood the tenant would be  operating a clothing store when in fact it was selling marihuana, apparently  without first obtaining city permits. [3]     Canna Clinic left the premises in July 2015 because, in its view, Ms. Ahmed  breached her obligations to provide quiet enjoyment. Ms. Ahmed commenced  two separate actions. The first was commenced in Small Claims Court. She sought  approximately $25,000 in damages for damage to the property. That action was  dismissed at a trial conference on April 19, 2017, because Ms. Ahmed had  failed to comply with orders made by the Small Claims Court to file and serve a  trial statement and to produce certain documents. On November 21, 2017, Madam  Justice Iyer of the Supreme Court of British Columbia dismissed Ms. Ahmed’s  appeal from that decision. This Court declared Ms. Ahmed’s notice of  appeal from Madam Justice Iyer’s decision a nullity in reasons indexed as 2018  BCCA 114, because there is no right of appeal to this Court from a small claims  order. [4]     Ms. Ahmed then commenced a second action in B.C. Supreme Court,  again seeking damages for damage to the rental property left, she says, by Canna  Clinic and, in addition, $268,000 in unpaid rent to the end of the lease term. Canna  Clinic applied to dismiss the second action on the basis of cause of action  estoppel. On May 23, 2017, Mr. Justice Steeves made that order. His  decision was upheld by this Court in reasons indexed as 2018 BCCA 319. Put  simply, this Court found that Ms. Ahmed had made a strategic decision to  start in Small Claims Court and, having failed there, could not simply start  over in a different court, even if additional breaches of the lease were being  pursued. [5]     In the meantime, before this Court heard the appeal from Mr. Justice  Steeve’s order, Ms. Ahmed applied to the Supreme Court for judicial review  of the April 2017 Provincial Court decision dismissing her action for $25,000  in damages. This amounted to the third time that she had attempted to litigate  the breaches of the lease she says Canna Clinic engaged in. The judge dismissed  Ms. Ahmed’s petition for judicial review. Ms. Ahmed now appeals. [6]     In my view, the judge did not make a mistake in the way he exercised his  discretion. He was aware that there is no time limit for starting a judicial  review proceeding, saying so expressly at para. 5 of his reasons for  judgment. He decided that too much time had gone by and that was a decision  open to him. [7]     The judge also refused judicial review because the issues raised had  already been dealt with in other court proceedings and could not be challenged  again. That is the same reason this Court gave in dismissing Ms. Ahmed’s  appeal to this Court last year:  Ahmed v. Canna Clinic,  2018 BCCA 319. The  judge made no error in his reasoning on this point. [8]     I see no merit in this part of the appeal. [9]     I turn now to Ms. Ahmed’s submission that the judge made a mistake  in ordering special costs against her. I agree with that submission. [10]     The judge considered Canna Clinic’s request for special costs and then  said: [9] THE COURT: Mr. Ahmed, I am not able to agree  with you and I hope you can take some lesson away from this, or your wife can,  or you both can. The courts are here to serve a function, which is to do  justice, but the courts are to do justice according to law, and the legal  process in this case has to come to an end, and that is where it ought to be  now. [10] I normally do what I  properly can to not award special costs against people who are unrepresented,  particularly when there is a lawyer on the other side, but I am ordering  special costs here, and I am doing it in accordance with these two cases that  have been cited. In both of them, you were the plaintiff. One was decided by  Madam Justice Fisher, as she then was, and the other by Mr. Justice  Willcock, as he then was. Your insults against the courts, the court  registries, and the judges cannot be accepted, and have to be punished with a  special costs order against you. [11]     It is clear from his reasons that the judge ordered special costs  against Mr. Ahmed, and yet the order provides that the petitioner, Ms. Ahmed,  is to pay special costs to Canna Clinic. This is a careless and troubling  mistake given that counsel obtained an order dispensing with Ms. Ahmed’s  signature. Counsel in that position has a particular responsibility to submit  an order that accurately reflects the court’s decision. It is also unfortunate  that the order was accepted and entered in the registry in a form that was not  consistent with the reasons. [12]     An appeal is from the order entered, and this order is not supported by  the judge’s reasons for judgment and must be set aside. If the judge intended  to order that Mr. Ahmed pay special costs personally, he did not address  the considerations applicable to a costs order against a non-party. While such  an order could have been made, it appears the judge assumed Mr. Ahmed was  a party as he had been in the two previous cases to which the judge referred. In  these circumstances I would therefore set aside the order for special costs and  replace it with an order that Ms. Ahmed, as the unsuccessful party in the  court below, is to pay ordinary costs at Scale B to Canna Clinic. [13]     As for the costs of this appeal, success has been divided. In my view,  each party should bear their own costs.  [14]     HARRIS J.A. : I agree. [15]     STROMBERG-STEIN J.A. : I agree. [16]     HARRIS J.A. : The appeal is allowed to the extent that the order  of special costs is set aside and replaced with an order on the terms described  in Madam Justice Fenlon’s reasons for judgment. Each party will bear their own  costs in this Court. [Discussion with Mr. Ahmed  re: seeking clarification] [17]     HARRIS J.A. : The reasons will be transcribed and made available  to you. You will then be able to understand clearly what it is we have ordered.  To summarize, we have ordered that each party will bear their own costs for  this appeal, so you do not have to pay anything in respect of that. Secondly,  insofar as the issue involving costs below from Mr. Justice Macintosh, the  order of special costs against Ms. Ahmed has been set aside. What she owes  are costs on the Party and Party Scale. “The  Honourable Madam Justice Fenlon”"},"meta":{},"created_at":"2022-03-10T01:19:20.467158Z","updated_at":"2022-03-10T01:19:20.467165Z","project":3},{"id":53,"annotations":[{"id":59,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"start":3,"end":40,"text":"THE SUPREME COURT OF BRITISH COLUMBIA","labels":["COURT_NAME"]},"id":"40d36c6d-9","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":51,"end":130,"text":"Barter v.

THE SUPREME COURT OF BRITISH COLUMBIA Citation: Barter v. British Columbia (Superintendent of Motor   Vehicles),   2022 BCSC 51   Date: 20220113 Docket: S175907 Registry:  Vancouver Between: Dale Barter Petitioner And The Superintendent  of Motor Vehicles And The  Attorney General of British Columbia Respondents Corrected  Judgment: The text of the judgment was corrected at the front page and    the header on January 21, 2022. Before:  The Honourable Mr. Justice Mayer On  judicial review from: An amended decision of an adjudicator, Office of the  Superintendent of Motor Vehicles, dated June 28, 2017    re: Immediate Roadside Prohibition No. 21-6066165  Reasons for Judgment Counsel for the Petitioner: K.M. Lee Counsel for the Respondents: K. Hogg     M. Bennett Place and Date of Trial\/Hearing: Vancouver, B.C. January 4, 2022 Place and Date of Judgment: Vancouver, B.C. January 13, 2022   [1]     On July 13, 2016 the petitioner, Dale Barter, was issued a 90-day  immediate roadside prohibition (“IRP”) pursuant to s. 215.41 of the  Motor  Vehicle Act , R.S.B.C. 1998, c. 318 [ MVA ] on the basis that he  had failed, or refused without reasonable excuse, to comply with a demand to  provide a breath sample for analysis on an approved screening device (“ASD”) to  police. A refusal to provide a breath sample results in the same penalty as a  “FAIL” reading on an ASD – that is, a reading that the driver’s blood\/alcohol  count is over the legal limit.  [2]     Mr. Barter’s subsequent application to set aside the IRP was  refused by a delegate of the Superintendent of Motor Vehicles (the  “Adjudicator”) in an amended decision dated on June 28, 2017 (the “Decision”).  The Adjudicator found that Mr. Barter had deliberately, without reasonable  excuse, failed to provide a suitable breath sample.  [3]     In the application before me, Mr. Barter seeks an order that the  Decision be set aside and the matter remitted back to the Superintendent of Motor  Vehicles (the “Superintendent”) for rehearing. Mr. Barter contends that  the Adjudicator made an unreasonable decision in finding that he had failed to  comply with a demand to provide a breath sample.  [4]     In the Decision the Adjudicator noted that because the evidence of Mr. Barter  and the police officer who issued the IRP was contradictory regarding the  efforts Mr. Barter had made to provide a breath sample, that it was  necessary to determine whose evidence was more credible.  [5]     The analysis of the Adjudicator on this issue is as follows:  Your evidence is that you were trying your best to provide a  proper breath sample. Before each attempt you took a deep breath and blew  genuinely for as long and hard as you could. You were provided with seven  opportunities to provide a suitable breath sample into the ASD and Officer Gunn  used more than one mouthpiece. You told Officer Gunn that you have asthma. You  indicate that you begged for another chance after the seventh attempt, but  Officer Gunn refused. Officer Gunn’s evidence is that he gave you seven  opportunities to provide a breath sample and used three different mouthpieces. He  observed you walking, talking and breathing normally. He observed that you  would blow for a short time and then relax your grip on the mouthpiece with  your lips and then blow around the mouthpiece, rather than into it. He also  observed you blow for a short time and then inhale your breath. Officer Gunn  also indicates that he gave you the option of continuing to try with a  different mouthpiece or ASD and you stated, “The same thing will keep  happening”. In determining which evidence is more credible, I have  considered the following: ·     Having asthma, in and of itself, does not mean that you are  incapable of providing a suitable breath sample into an ASD. ·     You have provided no medical evidence from your doctor to  indicate that your asthma precluded you from providing a proper breath sample  into the ASD. ·     Other than telling Officer Gunn that you have asthma, you have provided  no evidence to indicate that you were suffering from the symptoms of asthma at  the time you were to provide a breath sample. In fact, in your affidavit you  state, “I was blowing a long, hard, steady, and continuous blow into the  machine.” ·     I find your lack of asthmatic symptoms is supported by Officer  Gunn’s evidence that you were talking and breathing normally. ·     Although you indicate that Officer Gunn offered to take you for a  blood test at the hospital, I find this highly improbable. Officer Gunn made a  demand for a sample breath under section 254(2) of the  Criminal Code ; a  sample of blood may only be taken from a person pursuant to a demand made under  section 254(3). ·     Providing a breath sample into an ASD is a simple act of inhaling  and then blowing into the mouthpiece for a few seconds until the ASD analyzes  the sample. Because I have found that the evidence supports that the ASD  that Officer Gunn used was functioning properly, I find that if you had blown  into the ASD as you describe in your affidavit, your breath would have been  analyzed by the ASD. In contrast, I find that your attempts to provide a breath  sample as described in detail in Officer Gunn’s sworn evidence, would not have  resulted in an analysis by a properly functioning ASD. In considering the totality of  the evidence, I find that you have provided no persuasive evidence that would  lead me to conclude that you intended to provide a breath sample and that it  was your asthma or the unreliability of the ASD that precluded you from complying  with the demand. I find Officer Gunn’s evidence that you deliberately failed to  provide a suitable breath sample into the ASD, more credible. In summary, I do  not find that you had a reasonable excuse for failing or refusing to comply  with the ASD demand. [6]     Section 215.48 of the  MVA  establishes the right of a person  served with an IRP to apply for a review before the Superintendent or their  delegate. Section 215.5(1) of the  MVA  prescribes that “the burden of  proof in a review of a driving prohibition under section 215.48 is on the  person on whom the notice of driving prohibition was served”.  [7]     The parties agree that a reasonableness standard applies to the issues  on this review.  [8]     A reasonableness review requires the reviewing court to consider whether  the decision maker’s reasoning is “based on an internally coherent and rational  chain of analysis and that is justified in relations to the facts and law that  constrain the decision maker”:  Canada (Minister of Citizenship and  Immigration) v. Vavilov , 2019 SCC 65, at para. 85 [ Vavilov ].  [9]     In this application, in order to send this matter back to the  Superintendent for reconsideration, this Court must be satisfied that there are  shortcomings in the Decision which are sufficiently serious such that the  Decision does not exhibit the requisite degree of justification,  intelligibility and transparency. This Court must be satisfied that any alleged  shortcomings or flaws in the decision are sufficiently central or significant to  render the Decision unreasonable:  Vavilov,  at para. 100  [10]     This Court is not to reweigh and reassess the evidence considered by the  decision maker and must not interfere with findings of fact absent exceptional  circumstances:  Vavilov,  at para. 125.  [11]     In roadside driving prohibitions, credibility is frequently the central  issue. This Court should not substitute its own credibility findings for those  of an adjudicator. Reasons, which are flawed in one respect, must be considered  in their entirety in order to determine whether the flaw is central to the  decision:  Kenyon v. British Columbia (Superintendent of Motor Vehicles),   2015 BCCA 485, at para. 55.  [12]     In order to overturn a credibility finding, this Court must find that  the petitioner has proven that the finding was made on evidence that was not  before the adjudicator or that the adjudicator failed to grapple with clear  material conflicts in the evidence:  Lemieux v. British Columbia  (Superintendent of Motor Vehicles),  2019 BCCA 230 at paras. 102 and  119 [ Lemieux ].  [13]     Where credibility is at issue, an  assessment of credibility involves examination of factors including, amongst  others, whether the witness’ testimony seems unreasonable, impossible, or  unlikely:  Bradshaw v. Stenner,  2010 BCSC 1398,   at para. 186.   [14]     Mr. Barter contends that the Adjudicator’s reasoning process was  unreasonable for the following reasons:  a)   The Adjudicator  failed to properly consider his evidence and considered irrelevant evidence in  assessing his credibility, being his statement made to police roadside that he  suffered from asthma.  b)   The evidence set  out in his unsworn affidavit provided in the IRP review, that “he was trying  his best” to blow into the ASD, is not logically undermined by the fact that he  told the officer roadside that he had asthma.  c)   The  Adjudicator’s determination that it was unlikely that the police officer  offered to take Mr. Barter to the hospital to provide a blood sample was  unreasonable as there was no evidence from the officer to contradict Mr. Barter’s  evidence that such an offer was made.  d)   The  Adjudicator’s statement that the act of providing a breath sample was simply to  inhale and then to blow into the ASD mouthpiece is not grounded in any evidence  before the Adjudicator.  e)   The  Adjudicator’s conclusion that if Mr. Barter had blown into the ASD as he  described in his affidavit, that his breath would have been analyzed by the ASD  is an example of inappropriate “bootstrap” reasoning.  [15]     The Superintendent’s position is that the Adjudicator’s reasoning as set  out in the Decision is transparent, justifiable and intelligible and falls  within a range of possible, acceptable outcomes and is defensible in respect of  the facts and law.  [16]     In the Decision the Adjudicator quoted the evidence of the police  officer, summarizing his interaction with Mr. Barter on July 13, 2016 as  follows:  Despite walking, talking and  breathing normally, the driver would not provide a suitable sample of his  breath. The driver stated that he could not provide a sample due to asthma,  however was observed by Cst. GUNN to speak normally and walk normally without  strained breathing ... [17]     In his unsworn affidavit provided in the IRP review Mr. Barter did  not raise the issue of his asthma as a reasonable excuse for not providing a  suitable breath sample. He stated, in summary, that he made a genuine effort to  blow into the ASD for as long as he could, did not block the mouthpiece, blow  through his teeth, or blow in short spurts and that each time he attempted to  blow made a tight seal with his lips around the mouthpiece and blew a long,  hard, steady and continuous breath. He also stated in his unsworn affidavit  that there must have been something wrong with the ASD and its calibration  which kept it from accepting his breath sample.  [18]     In my view, the fact that Mr. Barter did not raise asthma as an  explanation for not providing a breath sample in the IRP review did not bar the  Adjudicator from considering his statement to police roadside in an assessment  of his credibility.  [19]     The circumstances in  Swick v. British Columbia (Superintendent of  Motor Vehicles),  2018 BCSC 1014 (affirmed in  Lemieux ) [ Swick ],  are similar to those before me in this judicial review. In  Swick  the  driver, Ms. Swick, was issued an IRP for refusing to provide a breath  sample and had told the officer that she was unable to do so due to a medical  issue that restricted her breathing. At the review before an adjudicator the  driver argued that the ASD must have malfunctioned.  Swick,  at para. 50.   [20]     Justice Duncan stated as follows at para. 53 of her decision in  Swick :   It was up to the adjudicator to  decide the extent to which the inconsistencies in Ms. Swick’s statements  undermined her credibility and how that may affect whether or not she met the  burden of proof on review. This was not a case where the inconsistency was a  minor one or related to a tangential issue. The conflicting statements were  squarely concerned with whether or not Ms. Swick was truly attempting to  provide a breath sample, or whether some medical condition might have precluded  her from doing so. The adjudicator’s finding that there was no way to  rationalize the two statements with a  bona fide  attempt to provide a  sample at roadside does not establish an unfair application of the burden of  proof. More accurately, it shows that Ms. Swick was unable to convince the  adjudicator on a balance of probabilities that her evidence should be preferred  over that of Constable Rekers. The adjudicator’s decision in this regard was  justifiable, transparent and intelligible and clearly falls within a range of  reasonable acceptable outcomes. [21]     The Court of Appeal stated as follows at para. 101 of  Lemieux :   In the absence of a dispute of  the officer’s evidence regarding what Ms. Swick said at roadside, it was open  to the adjudicator to accept the peace officer’s evidence. It was then open to  the adjudicator to conclude that Ms. Swick’s explanation at roadside belied her  affidavit evidence and to give reduced weight to her evidence.  [22]     I adopt the reasoning of Justice Duncan in  Swick  which was  affirmed by the Court of Appeal in  Lemieux.  [23]     The issue of whether or not Mr. Barter made a concerted effort to  blow into an ASD device or was unable to do so as a result of asthma was the  central issue to be determined by the Adjudicator. Mr. Barter does not  take issue with the evidence regarding his statements concerning asthma made to  police before the IRP was issued, which are inconsistent with the evidence in  his unsworn affidavit that he blew into the ASD mouthpiece long and hard and  had not relaxed his lips around the mouthpiece.  [24]     I find that in this case it was open and reasonable for the Adjudicator  to consider Mr. Barter’s inconsistent excuses for his failure to provide a  breath sample in her assessment of his credibility.  [25]     Mr. Barter contends that there was no evidence on which the  Adjudicator could find, as she did, that it was unlikely that the officer  offered to take him to the hospital for a blood test – and therefore it was not  reasonable for her to discount his evidence that such an offer had been made in  assessing his credibility.  [26]     The Superintendent responds that it was not unreasonable for the  Adjudicator to determine that it was highly improbable that the officer had  offered to take Mr. Barter to the hospital for a blood test as blood tests  are not part of the IRP scheme.  [27]     I agree with Mr. Barter’s submissions on this issue. Simply because  blood tests are not part of the IRP scheme does not lead to a reasonable  conclusion, in the absence of conflicting evidence, that the officer would not  have offered to take Mr. Barter to the hospital for a blood test.  [28]     I find, given the absence of conflicting evidence on this point, that it  was unreasonable for the Adjudicator to consider the issue of whether or not  police had offered to take Mr. Barter to the hospital for a blood test in  assessing his credibility. Despite this finding, I am not satisfied that the  Adjudicator placed sufficient weight on this portion of her credibility  assessment to make her conclusion on credibility unreasonable, in light of all  of the available evidence.  [29]     In my view, the focus of the Adjudicator’s assessment of Mr. Barter’s  credibility was on the evidence concerning his efforts to provide a breath  sample. The question of whether or not the officer offered to take Mr. Barter  for a blood test was not sufficiently central or significant to render the  Adjudicator’s findings on credibility, and therefore the Decision,  unreasonable.  [30]     Mr. Barter contends that the Adjudicator ignored technical evidence  available to her, that factors including blowing at too low, too high, or an at  an inconsistent rate of flow impact ASD test results, and simply supplied her  own evidence that providing a breath sample involves a simple matter of  inhaling and blowing into an ASD.  [31]     I am not satisfied that the Adjudicator’s generic description of the  process of blowing into an ASD mouthpiece to obtain an ASD test result was  wrong. In my view, the Adjudicator was simply briefly describing the  breathalyzer process in a general way, as one of the factors she considered in  determining Mr. Barter’s credibility.  [32]     It appears that counsel for Mr. Barter asks this Court to conclude  that the Adjudicator somehow misinterpreted what was required in order for a  suitable breath sample to be obtained. I am not satisfied that this this is the  case. There was ample evidence before the Adjudicator with respect to the steps  that the officer took to obtain a suitable breath sample from Mr. Barter.  It was open to the Adjudicator to apply common sense and the evidence of the  officer in determining whether, in the absence of evidence that the ASD was  functioning properly, Mr. Barter had complied with the required breath  sampling process.  [33]     Mr. Barter contends that the Adjudicator’s reasoning process, by  relying on the fact that a suitable sample was not obtained from the ASD to  conclude that he had refused to provide a suitable breath sample, was  unreasonable.  [34]     It is not surprising that Mr. Barter did not admit that he did not  blow into the mouthpiece in the manner described in the officer’s evidence.  Again, Mr. Barter’s evidence was that he made a tight seal with his lips around  the mouthpiece and blew a long, hard, steady and continuous breath into the ASD.  It was not unreasonable for the Adjudicator to conclude, given her finding that  the ASD was functioning properly, that Mr. Barter must not have been  blowing as he described and on this basis to infer, as it is apparent the  Adjudicator did, that he must have intended to do so.  [35]     On this basis, I do not find that the Adjudicator’s finding that Mr. Barter  had not provided persuasive evidence that he intended to provide a breath  sample to be unreasonable.  [36]     As stated in  Vavilov , this Court  is not to reweigh and reassess the evidence considered by the adjudicator  absent and interfere with an adjudicator’s findings of fact absent exceptional  circumstances. I do not consider that exceptional circumstances have been made  out in this judicial review.  [37]     I am satisfied that the  Adjudicator appropriately weighed the evidence, and made credibility findings  based on relevant evidence, with respect to whether or not Mr. Barter  intentionally failed to provide a breath sample.  [38]     As a result, I do not find the  decision of the Adjudicator dismissing Mr. Barter’s review application in  respect of the IRP issued  July 13, 2016  to  be unreasonable.  [39]     Mr. Barter’s petition is  dismissed, without costs to any party.  “Mayer J.”"},"meta":{},"created_at":"2022-03-10T01:19:20.467093Z","updated_at":"2022-03-10T01:19:20.467110Z","project":3}]
