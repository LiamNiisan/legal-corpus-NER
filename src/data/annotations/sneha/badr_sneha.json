Borecky Date: 20000111 2000 BCSC 33 Docket: D110467 Registry: Vancouver IN THE SUPREME COURT OF BRITISH COLUMBIA BETWEEN: ISABELLE DIANE BORECKY PLAINTIFF AND: GARY WILLIAM BORECKY DEFENDANT REASONS FOR JUDGMENT OF THE HONOURABLE MR. JUSTICE HOOD Counsel for the Plaintiff: J. Bennett Counsel for the Defendant: D. Tupper Date and Place of Hearing: January 5 & 6, 2000 Vancouver, B.C. [1] In March 1999 I gave oral reasons for judgment at the end of the trial in this proceedings. I ordered the plaintiff mother to return the child, Jessie, from Ontario to reside in the Burnaby area, an area advantageous to all. I also ordered joint custody of the child, with her primary place of residence being with the plaintiff in the area referred to. I also ordered child maintenance pursuant to The Federal Child Support Guidelines, having fixed the defendant's income at $32,000.00, as well as spousal maintenance in the amount of $200.00 for one year, although not sought by the plaintiff. [2] During the trial the evidence was that it was likely that the defendant's income would increase in the near future as he became more established and more work became available. It was also understood that the plaintiff was going to need assistance while seeking employment, and getting back on her feet and so on; that she would have to pay daycare and other expenses which could not be dealt with at that time. [3] At trial the defendant said, in effect, that he would help the plaintiff re-establish herself in the Burnaby area, physically as well as financially, and I took him at his word. According to the plaintiff he did not keep it. The evidence of the parties in this, and other areas, clashes head-on and I do not propose to deal with it in these proceedings. However, I do observe that the plaintiff has re-established herself without assistance from the defendant. After returning to the Vancouver area she worked at two or three jobs, before landing a permanent job with Continuing Legal Education in August 1999. Her 1999 income was $24,800.00 which included monies from a number of sources including pension plan monies which the defendant was ordered to pay or transfer to her in the earlier proceedings. Her 2000 income from employment is expected to be $28,000.00. [4] When she returned to Vancouver the plaintiff did not reside in the Burnaby area as directed. However, she has now agreed to do so, and I need not deal with the reasons why she chose to reside in Richmond. It is understood that she will move to Burnaby in the summer, to an area reasonably close to the defendant's residence so as to accommodate access and other matters beneficial to the child. In this regard counsel will work out a brief guideline pertaining to the defendant's attendance at the plaintiff's residence, such as prior notice, times and so on. [5] I turn to the relief sought by the plaintiff in her notice of motion. As regards items #1 and #2, her divorce has been granted and the $73.36 in arrears has been paid. [6] As to item #3, she seeks an order pursuant to s.17 of The Divorce Act , and The Federal Child Support Guidelines , that the child support provisions of my order of March 19, 1999 in these proceedings be varied. The basis is that there has been a substantial increase in the defendant's income since April 1999, constituting a material change in circumstances. A second material change is also asserted in that she has required daycare and related services since May 1999. I am satisfied that the plaintiff requires full-time daycare, with the certainty which it will provide, given the uncertainty of the defendant's work schedule. I am also satisfied that the defendant must pay increased child support, and a proportionate share of the costs of these services, whether they are looked upon as material changes in circumstances or simply known obligations which the Court could not deal with at the time of the March 19, 1999 order, and therefore were left to be dealt with at a later date. The daycare and related costs, of course, are properly s.7 expenses. [7] I accept the figures set out in Ms. Bennett's hand-up, which I assume was exhibited in the proceedings, as adjusted a bit by both counsel, and, I believe, agreed to. The Federal Child Support Guideline table amount of child support to be paid commencing January 1, 2000, is $396.00 per month. [8] The defendant's income for 2000 will be $46,372.00. The plaintiff's income will be $28,000.00. The defendant's proportionate share of Jessie's health care premium of $72.00 is 63% or $45.00. His similar proportionate share of the child care costs of $565.00 is $356.00. He therefore will pay, commencing January 1, 2000, the further sum of $401.00, being his proportionate share of the s.7 expenses. [9] The plaintiff also seeks an order varying the March 19, 1999 order for child support retro-active to May 1, 1999, the point in time when the changes referred to occurred, that is, when the defendant's income was increased and the plaintiff commenced to incur daycare and related expenses. Particulars of this claim are set out in pg 2 of Ms. Bennett's hand-up as follows: Table amount differential: $396-$280=116x8 months = $ 928 Health Care premiums: $72x65%=$47x4 months = $ 188 Child care: $262 deposit to Angels Daycare $ 262 $525x8 months to Angels Daycare $4,200 Less daycare subsidy of $354x5 months <1,770> $40 x 4 months to care between daycare and school $ 160 $25 x 2 to child care when Angels Daycare closed $ 50 $2,902x65% $1,886 $3,002 Table amount differential: $396-$280=116x8 months = $ 928 Health Care premiums: $72x65%=$47x4 months = $ 188 Child care: $262 deposit to Angels Daycare $ 262 $525x8 months to Angels Daycare $4,200 Less daycare subsidy of $354x5 months <1,770> $40 x 4 months to care between daycare and school $ 160 $25 x 2 to child care when Angels Daycare closed $ 50 $2,902x65% $1,886 $3,002 The proportionate share of 65% is based on the plaintiff's 1999 income being $24,800.00 and the defendant's income being $46,372.00. [10] In my opinion the defendant's obligation to pay these monies, and Jessie's entitlement to them, arose on or about May 1, 1999. I do not think it necessary to deal with the evidence as to why the defendant did not advise the plaintiff of the increase in his income, or why he did not assist her by increasing the monthly child support payment and, in particular, by paying a proportionate share of the child care costs. During at least a portion of this period the plaintiff had very little income and had to rely on monies borrowed from relatives, as well as a portion of the RRSP monies to which I have referred. [11] There is authority for the retroactive child maintenance order sought, which order is discretionary. See the decision of the Court of Appeal in L.S. v. E.P. (1999), B.C.C.A. 393. There at pg. 15 Madam Justice Rowles, speaking for the Court, commences her discussion of the various factors, both positive and negative, which the Courts have considered or emphasised when deciding whether to exercise the discretion and make the order. [12] In the case at Bar the plaintiff has established most of the factors militating in favour of the order, and none of those militating against the order appears to be present. For example, there was and is a need on the part of the child and a corresponding ability on the part of the defendant to pay. There is some blameworthy conduct on the part of the defendant in the circumstances in failing to meet his known obligations when they arose, and in failing to disclose the increase in his income when declaring his financial situation. And the plaintiff was forced to encroach on her capital and to incur debt, which would not have been necessary had the support been forthcoming from the defendant. [13] This is not a case of inexcusably delayed or stale claims, or of an unreasonable burden being placed on the defendant. He has always known of these obligations, and any delay in meeting them, which he knew would create hardship for the child and the plaintiff, must be attributed to him. In my view, in the circumstances of the case, even if the payment of the monies if ordered to be paid would create a hardship on the defendant, which I do not believe is the case, he should not be entitled to benefit from his deliberate conduct and then plead hardship at the expense of his child and the custodial mother. Reasonableness and fairness are the key factors in such circumstances. [14] In summary, while some of the factors discussed by Madam Justice Rowles may be determinative in a given case, it is my opinion in the case at Bar that there are no factors alone or combined which militate against the order. On the contrary, the facts clearly support the exercise of the discretion in favour of the plaintiff and the child. I therefore conclude that the defendant must pay the $3,002.00 to the plaintiff. [15] The plaintiff also seeks in her Notice of Motion an order for specified access for the defendant, in conjunction with an order that she may move the habitual residence of Jessie to the Province of Ontario. Both matters, items #4 and #5, have been adjourned and it is not necessary for me to deal with the conflicting affidavit evidence pertaining to them. Obviously such matters cannot be resolved by way of a summary proceeding, but will require testimony of the parties and perhaps others, if they are to proceed. [16] I observe also that notwithstanding their love for Jessie, it appears that there is still much animosity between the parties. The defendant asserts that the plaintiff continues with her former conduct which I commented on in my earlier reasons. He says that she will not co-operate. She continues to disrupt and dominate his telephone calls with Jessie, and to make everything difficult, including access, all for the stated purpose of obtaining court approval for her to take Jessie back to Ontario to reside. The plaintiff, of course, denies these assertions. She alleges that it is he who will not co-operate with or help her, and who makes matters difficult. [17] It is unfortunate for Jessie that this state of affairs has been allowed to continue. She is the one who will pay its price. The parties have already been warned that their conduct may well reflect their custodial and access rights in the future. [18] There are two remaining additional matters. First the plaintiff requests that I direct the defendant to make his best efforts to obtain airline tickets from his father for Jessie when the plaintiff wishes to visit her relatives in the east. She does not seek an order that he pay any portion of such costs. I understand that the defendant is willing to make his best efforts for tickets for Jessie, and I need not deal with the matter further. [19] Finally, the plaintiff seeks an order that the child maintenance be secured by the defendant obtaining a life insurance policy. There is no evidentiary basis before me to support such an order and I decline to make it. [20] The plaintiff will have her costs. \"Hood, J.\" Vancouver, B.C.

JUSTICE LAMBERT IN CHAMBERS Vancouver, B.C. BETWEEN: ALICE MARY LOUISE DAVIS PLAINTIFF (RESPONDENT) AND: RONALD EDWARD PERKINS DEFENDANT (APPELLANT) L.A. Macdonald appearing for the Appellant C. Marcotte appearing for the Respondent (application for leave to appeal) LAMBERT, J.A.: This is an application for leave to appeal an order for interim maintenance. The circumstances of the parties in their domestic relationship are somewhat unusual and their financial arrangements more unusual still. The application for maintenance is made by Mrs. Davis who is the plaintiff. She has had two children by Mr. Perkins who is the defendant. The children are now 17 years old and 14 years old. She and Mr. Perkins have had a long standing relationship. Mr. Perkins has remained throughout that period married to Mrs. Perkins and throughout that period has lived at the matrimonial home shared by Mr. and Mrs. Perkins. The Perkins have one child who is now 30 years old. The financial affairs of Mr. and Mrs. Perkins and Mr. Perkins' father and Mrs. Davis all involve a series of contracts for the distribution of local and regional newspapers. Those contracts were altered in their form in 1980 or thereabouts when Mr. Perkins was experiencing difficulties with the Income Tax Department and trying to shelter himself from an obligation which might be imposed, he thought wrongfully, on him in relation to income tax. In the course of the intervening years the contracts have remained unusual in their set-up, perhaps influenced by Mr. Perkins' continuing problems with the Income Tax Department. Mrs. Perkins' from her employment, which as I understand it is in the newspaper area, has an income of about $33,000 a year. Mrs. Davis, from a contract for the distribution of the Vancouver Sun, has an income of about $25,000 a year. Before she had that income she was in receipt of Welfare and her two children were from time to time assisted by Welfare payments though Mr. Perkins has from time to time paid money to Mrs. Davis over the course of their relationship, at least since the children were born. It was against these difficult circumstances and in reliance on affidavit evidence that was not entirely explicable that Mr. Justice MacKinnon had to decide the amount of interim maintenance. The interim maintenance order, it seems likely, will be in effect until after November, 1992, because that is the date now set for the hearing of Mr. Perkins' application for an order that he has a trust interest in the house registered in the name of Mrs. Davis. He concedes that if it were established that he had that interest in that property then that property could be used to pay or secure the maintenance payments to the children. Mr. Perkins' position is that he has no assets at all and no income at all from which it could possibly be said that he could pay any amount of maintenance. Mrs. Perkins has announced that she is unwilling to mortgage her interest in the family home further than it is now mortgaged in order to free up funds, or to pay funds out of her own salary, which would ultimately be used, by going from her through Mr. Perkins, for the support of the children. Of course, no order could be made, or at least no order is requested, asking her to pay any such amount. On the other hand if Mr. Perkins has arranged his affairs with his wife so that she has income and he does not, then it is not improper for this Court or the trial court to order that he pay maintenance and it is up to him to obtain the funds to do it. I was referred to the decision of Haigh v. Haigh (1987) 9 R.F.L. (3d) 301. There Mr. Justice Wallace for the Court set out the position that has been set out in many other cases, namely, that this Court should not interfere with the amount of an award of interim maintenance unless it is based on the application of a wrong principle of law, unless it is based on the mis-assessment of the evidence, or unless the amount so ordered is inordinately high or inordinately low. Interim maintenance cases present great difficulties in reassessment on an appeal because the situation of the parties is very often changing from month to month. By the time the appeal comes on for hearing the situation is often different than when the interim order was made. It is impossible to tinker on a monthly basis in the light of constantly changing financial circumstances and all that is recognized when the interim order is set. Two hundred and fifty dollars does not support a teenage child, far from it. The order that was made by Mr. Justice MacKinnon was for maintenance in the amount of $250 per month for each of these two children. I assume that the order would come to an end for the oldest child when that oldest child ceases to be a child entitled to maintenance under the Family Relations Act . There is one final matter that properly influences the decision on whether leave to appeal should be granted. This order was made on the 22 July, 1991. No maintenance of any kind has been paid under the order in the intervening six months. It is a proper factor to take into account in deciding whether to grant leave to appeal to consider whether any payment has been made under the order. If there are good reasons for not making the payment there is a forum in which those reasons could be advanced. It certainly militates against granting leave to appeal that the order has not been complied with in the smallest particular. In my opinion, it cannot be said, in all of the circumstances of this case, that Mr. Justice MacKinnon erred in principle or mis-assessed the facts or made an award that was inordinately high. Indeed, I do not think any argument can be made that has any significant possibility of success to the effect that Mr. Justice MacKinnon erred in principle, mis-assessed the facts, or made an award that was inordinately high.

JUSTICE LEGGATT THE CORPORATION OF DELTA ) ) RESPONDENT ) ) R. H. Guile counsel for petitioner D.D. McLellan counsel for respondent Date and place of hearing: December 4 and 5, 1990 at Vancouver, B.C. This is an application under the Judicial Review Procedure Act , R.S.B.C. 1979, c. 209. The corporate petitioner, Delsom Estates Ltd., owns approximately 140 acres of land within the Municipality of Delta. It wishes to lease a 6 acre portion of this property, located at 10681 - 84th Avenue, Delta, to the Marlborough College Society for the operation of a private school. This land is presently zoned as RS-3 (family residential), but is designated on the official community plan as \"Commercial: Town Centre, Service, Residential and Marine\/Resort\". There is a long history of attempts by the petitioners to obtain the necessary rezoning and permits with regard to this particular property. The Delta Municipal Council has to this date rejected all applications for rezoning and permits. The relationship between petitioners and respondent has been fractious; court proceedings have been initiated several times. Although it is not necessary to review, in detail, the whole history of this property, a brief summary of the recent facts leading to this application are necessary. In early 1988, the petitioners began construction of the Marlborough College without work permit, development permit, temporary use permit, or any other authorization. The petitioner Elsom then applied for a temporary permit. Council decided that they would not entertain further development on the subject lands until the issue of public open space requirements had been resolved. The petitioners then applied for judicial review. On August 30, 1988, MacEachern CJSC, as he then was, declared that all considerations of public park space were irrelevant and that the Council should reconsider the application. The council complied. On September 6, 1988, council refused to grant the petitioners a temporary use permit; on October 24, 1988, it rejected the petitioners' application for rezoning. Again, the petitioners applied for judicial review. On January 18, 1989, Macdonnell J. held that, on the whole, neither decision had been improperly made. The petitioners have appealed the ruling. Shortly afterwards, on March 8, 1989, Mr. Elsom retained a solicitor, William T. Lane, to act as an intermediary between himself and the council, in an attempt to resolve all outstanding differences between them. Mr. Lane entered into negotiations with the council, and eventually an agreement was reached. The plans for the school were agreed upon by both Lane, on behalf of the petitioners, and council. An application for rezoning was then filed with the Municipality. The rezoning was to be approved through the enactment of two bylaws, pursuant to the agreement, the council held first, second and third reading, plus a public hearing on the bylaws. No problems arose. Before fourth and final reading of the bylaws, the petitioners replaced the original plans, which formed the basis of the rezoning application, with a brand new set of plans. The new plans represented a drastic change, as the difference in price indicates; the original building cost was budgeted at $2,000,000.00, whereas the new building would cost only $500,000.00. On November 6, 1989, the council was asked to proceed to a fourth reading of the rezoning bylaws based on plans that it had never considered before. After a short debate, council passed a motion to rescind the bylaws and in effect terminated the process. In support of their application for mandamus, the petitioners have alleged, in an effort to prove its bad faith, a long history of wrong doing on the part of the council. Also, both counsel have argued at length about the powers given to municipalities under the Municipality Act . Under the circumstances, most of the factual and legal arguments are of little application. I agree with the respondent that Macdonnell J. ruled on the same issues of bad faith, denial of natural justice, and irrelevant considerations as they applied to the facts up to October 24, 1988. To that extent, those issues are res judicata. Further, it is clear that it is the November 6, 1989 decision not to proceed with fourth reading that lies at the heart of this application. The main issue is whether the decision was properly made, or whether council should be ordered to proceed with fourth reading. Fortunately, Mr. Elsom had transcripts made of the November 6, 1989 meeting and the reasoning of the council can be fully examined. The petitioner has advanced several grounds for judicial review. First, they allege that irrelevant and extraneous considerations were the basis for the decision not to rezone the property. In particular, the petitioners submit that council based its decision on the availability of public space and on the modular design of the school buildings, both declared irrelevant in the previous proceedings. However, the transcripts of the November 6, 1989 meeting contain no mention of either requirement. Rather, it is clear that council rescinded the bylaws because of an unexpected change in plans. Alderman Jackson summarized the opinion of council thus: As a matter of principle, we dealt with Plan A at public hearing, it was given third reading, it was expedited though first and second, and we are looking at an entire change of plans. And on the that basis, I'm afraid I can't deal with it as a proposal. If I were dealing with the original proposal, we could deal with it at fourth reading or whatgever, but we don't have that before us. (p.9) The main purpose of public readings and public hearings is to give the public an opportunity to respond to the impending legislation. Had the council proceeded to a fourth reading on a new set of plans, it would have nullified this purpose. In fact, the council clearly acted on what they believed to be the best interest of the community. This ground of review must fail. The petitioners further complain that at the meeting of November 6, 1989, Mr. Elsom was not allowed to explain to the council the reason for removing the plans. The following explanation was offered in argument. The original plans had been agreed by the council and Mr. Lane, on behalf of Mr. Elsom, while Mr. Elsom was in England. When Mr. Elsom returned, he reviewed the plans and found them unacceptable. Apparently, he attempted to advise council of both his concerns with respect to the original plans and of the proposed modifications to them. The petitioners submit that council's refusals to hear Mr. Elsom both before and during the November 6, 1989 meeting amounted to a denial of natural justice. Admittedly, in general, the right to be heard is present in all administrative decisions. Under the circumstances, however, council did not act improperly. As pointed out above, the transcripts show that council was concerned about the requirement of public notice, which would not have been met had a fourth reading been held. Whatever reasons Mr. Elsom might have offered to the council, there had been a substantial change in plans. Therefore, even if Mr. Elsom had been allowed to speak, the decision of the council would not have been affected. Its first duty was to the public, not Mr. Elsom. The next ground of complaint is the internal report prepared by the Municipality, which recommended that the rezoning not be approved. This report was presented at the meeting of November 6, 1989, and there was a motion to adopt its recommendations. The petitioners point out that they do not have access to internal reports prior to hearings, and therefore do not have an opportunity to respond in any fashion. The respondent argues that it is standard policy not to release internal reports to the public before the aldermen have a chance to review it. The transcripts of the meeting show that this is a moot point; the rezoning bylaws were rescinded because of the unannounced change in plans, not because of the internal report; thus, I need not decide if council's policy amounts to a denial of natural justice. However, at least prima facie, it appears that Mr. Elsom, and all other applicants for rezoning, are not given an opportunity to answer the case against them. This may well be unacceptable and the council may want to consider changing its policy in order to make the reports available, at least to the parties most directly affected by them. There is evidence that council wants the petitioners to commit themselves to a comprehensive development plan for the surrounding property, also owned by the petitioners. The petitioners argue that development is an irrelevant consideration. This issue was resolved by Macdonnell J. in the previous application: The Delta council has decided that it will not rezone the property in question until it has received more information with respect to the development plans for the surrounding property. In terms of planning, this is a relevant consideration. If the subject property is rezoned to P1 (public use), the surrounding land would need to be zoned and developed in ways which would complement, rather than conflict with, a \"public use area\". (p. 269) The petitioners concede that Delta may have a legitimate basis for considering the adjacent lands with respect to the particular rezoning application, but they submit that this right does not go as far as forcing the petitioners to commit themselves to a comprehensive plan for development of its land holdings. The fact that the petitioners are the owners of several adjacent parcels of land, they insist, should not be allowed to intrude upon a particular application for rezoning. Again, the reasoning of Macdonnell answers the objection. Council has, in effect, decided that it needs more information before it can make a proper determination of the rezoning application. It is not for the Court to weigh the sufficiency of the material before council and impose its opinion as to whether council should rezone or not. Council has the responsibility of deciding whether rezoning is to be allowed or not. The petitioner has no right at law to rezone. The matter is in the discretion of council alone, and it is only accountable to the electorate for its lawful decision. (p. 269) Finally, the petitioners have listed several other acts by the municipality, which they submit prove that the council continue to act in bad faith, singling out the petitioners for inordinately harsh treatment. On the whole, it is apparent that the relationship between petitioners and respondent are strained. However, none of the acts complained of amount to misconduct of such a nature as to justify a judicial review remedy. Accordingly, the petition is dismissed with costs. S.M. LEGGATT, J.

JUSTICE DAVIES ) A N D: ) ) DONALD ROY and ) INSURANCE CORPORATION ) OF BRITISH COLUMBIA ) Ellen Bond, Esq. Counsel for the Plaintiff John P. Lauener, Esq. Counsel for the Defendants The plaintiff claims damages for injuries arising out of a motor vehicle accident that occurred January l5th, l986. The defendants have offered no defence to the evidence led by the Plaintiff clearly indicating negligence on the part of the driver of the motor vehicle owned by the defendant, Roy. I therefore find responsibility for the accident on the defendant, Donald Roy. The plaintiff had stopped at an intersection when his vehicle was hit on the front left quadrant by the defendant's vehicle which was turning. The defendant's vehicle then spun around and struck the plaintiff's vehicle a second time. It then struck another car before leaving the scene of the accident. - 2 - The plaintiff's head hit the roof of his vehicle as a result of the initial impact. He was taken by ambulance to the Burnaby General Hospital. There he was treated in the Emergency Department, and released later the same day. He saw his family doctor, Dr. Herbert Lee, the following day. At that time he was complaining of dizziness, headaches, pain in his left chest, pain in his neck with restricted movement and noises in his ears which he described as \"birdlike.\" His headaches decreased over the next few weeks, however, the pain in his neck became worse and he was referred to Dr. I. Tsang, a Rheumatologist. In a report dated February 2nd, l988, Dr. Tsang reported as follows: \"After his first visit with me my impression was that he sustained a soft tissue injury to his neck area and the left interior chest wall from the accident. I think that he was then on his way to recovery which will be enhanced by pysiotherapy. I sent him to the Pysiotherapy Department at Shaughnessy Hospital for treatment and I subsequently saw him March l3th and April 28th, l986. During those visits, he reported continued improvement with his neck pain and the shoulder movement. The chest pain was improving as well. I encouraged him to continue on with the pysiotherapy and indicated to him that it was important to do his - 3 - exercises at home. I did not see him again until December 7th, l987. At that visit he informed me that since his last visit with me in April l986, he continued to have discomfort in his neck and the discomfort was worsened with changes in the weather. He was suffering from dizzy spells with movement of his neck as well. The dizziness was described as a sensation of light headedness, but at times there was true vertigo........................ Because of the ongoing neck symptoms an X-ray of his cervical spine was done and the X-rays showed radiological evidence of boney ankylosis compatible with DISH SYNDROME. The movement of his cervical spine had deteriorated since his physiotherapy and when I saw him again on December 4th, l987, he had about fifty percent decrease in range of motion of the cervical spine in all directions............................................... \"DISH SYNDROME\" is a medical condition of unknown etiology. The patient who suffers from Dish Syndrome develops excessive osteophyte formation along their vertebral column resulting in decreased range of motion of the affected area. They also tend to develop - 4 - excessive calcification of the tendons and ligaments and site of the attachment again resulting in deceased range of motion. This is an ongoing chronic condition and I believe in Mr. Da Assuncao the condition pre-existed his automobile accident and I do not believe the accident has affected the progress of his condition in any particular way. However, because of the accident and the decreased physical activity resulting from the aches and pains caused by the accident, it may result in further reduction of range of motion of his vertebral column and extremities and this is probably why the condition has become clinically more apparent since the accident.\" Mr. Da Assuncao continued to complain of dizziness and as a result, Dr. Lee referred him to Dr. C. Man, an Otolaryngologist. Dr. Man tested the plaintiff's hearing and found symmetrical hearing loss which he did not attribute to the accident. However, he did find evidence of damage to the vestibular system. In March of l987, the plaintiff was examined by Dr. Patricia R. Emmons, a Neurologist. Dr. Emmons reported in part as follows: \"It is my impression this man had a head injury when he was involved in the motor vehicle accident of January - 5 - l5th, l986, when his head hit the roof of the car and the side of the car and with the accident, he had an upset of the vestibular apparatus and his hearing. He has been followed by Dr. Man and he has had some gradual improvement in his ability to walk, but he has not yet been able to return to work because he cannot hear well enough and because he gets recruitment when he does hear more than one person speaking at a time. He cannot drive because if he moves his head to turn and look to one side or the other, he gets dizzy and off balance and this again inhibits him from doing his work.\" DIAGNOSIS: \"Vertigo of central etiology associated with injury to the labyrinth on the left causing difficulty in moving and walking and also associated decreased hearing. Neck soft tissue injury as a result of the sudden jarring associated with the accident.\" Mr. Da Assuncao was seen by yet another Neurologist, Dr. Jeff H. Beckman, in August of l987. Dr. Beckman took a history from the plaintiff and then examined him. The following is the comment given in his report of August l4th, l987: - 6 - \"Mr. Da Assuncao complains of mild residual signs of positional vertigo. It sounds as if he did have mild post traumatic vertigo after his accident which appears to be improving. He does complain of a hearing loss and although objectively he appears to have one, I would be interested to see what the Audiometry Report is on him. As far as his neck spasm goes, this appears to be minimal at this point in time. My suspicion is he tends to exaggarate it a bit and overall I assured him that this should continue to improve. I encouraged him to try and return to work and that he should attempt to practice driving in an empty parking lot on the weekend to see if he is able to be comfortable behind the wheel.\" Mr. Da Assuncao testified that his dizziness made him nervous about driving his automobile and the \"birdlike noises\" in his ears badly hampered his ability to communicate effectively. He stated that the dizziness improved only gradually and did not completely disappear until August of l989. He still complains of \"birdlike noises\" in his ears which he says interfere with his ability to hear. His headaches which followed the accident lasted for perhaps two months and the pain in his chest for six months. He has restricted neck movement, but this is not due to the accident. In summary, Mr. Da Assuncao, sufferred a blow to his head and - 7 - a whiplash type injury in the accident of January l5th, l986. His injuries resulted in headaches, pain and restricted movement in his neck, chest pain, dizziness and noises in his ears. The soft tissue injury to his neck and chest subsided in a matter of months, however, the dizziness and problem with his ears persisted. I believe that Mr. Da Assuncao's recovery was impeded because of depression caused by the accident. However, I do not believe that his injuries or his depression were as severe or lasted as long as he suggested. His recovery from these injuries was complicated by another motor vehicle accident in which he was involved January 8th, l989. At that time, he rear-ended another car and although he sufferred no physical injuries he was apparently shaken up sufficiently to be hospitalized for two days. On giving evidence, he complained of a loss of hearing. However, there is no medical evidence to indicate that his loss of hearing was a result of the accident. Indeed, I noted during the course of the trial that on occasions his hearing improved markedly when he became aggitated. In any event, he has now recovered from all of his injuries with the exception of the occasional ringing sound in his ears which is not impairing him in his occupation as a Real Estate Salesman. I affix his non-pecuniary damages at $l7,500.00. As I have mentioned, the plaintiff was employed as a Real Estate Salesman at the time of the accident. He was qualified as a Real Estate Salesman in l971 and has worked for a number of Real - 8 - Estate Companies in Vancouver. In or about l977 he commenced working with Stella Lee in a form of partnership. They found that they worked very effectively as a team with Mr. Da Assuncao obtaining most of the listings and Mrs. Lee being the specialist in selling. Much evidence was presented with respect to the plaintiff's earnings and Mrs. Lee's earnings in the years preceding the accident. The argument was made by the defendants that I should average the plaintiff's monthly income for two years prior to the motor vehicle accident and then calculate his earnings on that basis. I don't consider that to be a fair approach. A Real Estate Salesman's income will vary with the demand for real estate. In this case, I have the plaintiff's partner's income for the years following the accident as a guide. They had worked together for a number of years and split commissions earned except on rare occasions where one might have done all of the effective work on a particular sale. After reviewing the theories suggested for calculating loss of income, I have concluded that the appropriate approach is that suggested by the plaintiff which incorporates the calculations of Mr. John Struthers, a Consulting Economist, who was called by the plaintiff. Having concluded that the plaintiff should have been capable of returning to work full time in January l989 and using Mr. Struthers' figures giving the projected net income loss for the years l986, l987 and l988, I have determined - 9 - the plaintiff's loss of earnings as follows: 1986: $10,800.00 1987: $15,573.00 1988: $30,517.00 ___________ Total: $56,890.00 =========== However, because of the various contingencies in life which could well have affected the plaintiff's ability to earn income over the period I have found to be his period of loss, I have settled upon the figure of $45,000.00 as being a realistic figure for lost income. Therefore, the plaintiff is entitled to judgment as follows: Non-pecuniary damages: $l7,500.00 Loss of income: $45,000.00 Special damages: 69.82 - 10 - The plaintiff is also entitled to his costs and Court Order interest at the rates from time to time prescribed by the Registrar of this Honourable Court.

BETWEEN: CHRIS ALEXANDER BAJKOV, an Infant, by his Guardian Ad Litem, BARBARA BAJKOV, and the said BARBARA BAJKOV PLAINTIFFS (APPELLANTS) AND: MARIO ERNEST CANIL and BARBARA CANIL DEFENDANTS (RESPONDENTS) J. Vanstone, Esq. appearing for the Appellant F.H. Saunders, Esq. appearing for the Respondent HINKSON, J.A.: This is an appeal from the decision of a trial judge in which he held that as a result of an accident involving the plaintiff who was riding a bicycle and the defendant who was operating a truck, that each was at fault and he apportioned the blame equally between them pursuant to the provisions of the Negligence Act , R.S.B.C. 1979, c.204. The circumstances were that on March 16, 1987 the plaintiff, who was then 13 years of age, was riding his bicycle to school along Willemar Avenue in Courtenay. He was proceeding in a westerly direction. The defendant was driving his truck proceeding east along Willemar Avenue. The time was approximately 7:55 a.m., the plaintiff was proceeding to school and the defendant was proceeding to work. As the plaintiff approached the intersection of Willemar Avenue and 17th Street, he was just behind and to the right of a car that was also travelling west along Willemar at about the same speed as the infant was proceeding on his bicycle. The intersection of Willemar and 17th is a T-intersection, 17 Street proceeds north from Willemar from that point. There is a school in the vicinity of the intersection, bus stops for school busses to let pupils on and off the vehicles, there were signs indicating a school zone. The defendant let the westbound vehicle adjacent to which the plaintiff was travelling proceed through the intersection. He slowed to permit that but did not come to a stop and after the vehicle had passed him he commenced to make a left hand turn, cutting the corner to some degree, and came into collision with plaintiff in the crosswalk on the north side of the intersection. The plaintiff, as he approached the corner of the intersection, rode between a hydro pole and the curb over a bump in the asphalt. He jumped his bicycle on this bump and landed in the cross-walk. He did not see the defendant's vehicle until it was one or two feet away. The collision took place between the bicycle and the truck at the right front of the truck near the headlight and in the area of the cross-walk which was in the north bound portion of 17th Street. The defendant did not see the plaintiff until immediately before the impact. The trial judge held the defendant to be at fault for failing to keep a proper look-out. There was no excessive speed on the part of the defendant. He was proceeding at a speed of 20 kilometres or probably less than that at the point of impact. The defendant does not appeal from the decision of the trial judge that he was negligent in failing to keep a proper look-out, however, the plaintiff appeals upon the basis that the trial judge erred in finding that he was contributorily negligent. It is clear that the plaintiff was not looking ahead at the intersection as he took the path between the telephone pole and the curb and jumped the asphalt bump that was situate there. He did not see the defendant's vehicle turning in the intersection until it was a foot or two away, too late for him to avoid it. He contends that he had the right of way at that point and that therefore, he was entitled to exercise that right of way over the defendant and that in those circumstances the trial judge erred in finding that he was also at fault. The trial judge said this: The plaintiff was riding his bicycle across a crosswalk in violation of S.185(2)(a.1) of the Motor Vehicle Act. He was not keeping a look out for vehicles coming off Willemar Road and directed his attention to the bump and a successful jump. I find that his negligence contributed to the cause of the accident. He was well aware of the dangers of riding his bicycle in that way and so must accept the consequences. In my opinion, it is of significance that the accident took place when the plaintiff was in the crosswalk. The section to which the trial judge referred provides: (a.1) shall not, for the purpose of crossing a highway, ride on a crosswalk unless authorized to do so by a bylaw made under section 120 or unless otherwise directed by a sign; There was no sign and no bylaw in the present case. In those circumstances, in my opinion, the plaintiff was not entitled to rely on the fact that he had the right of way. He would have had the right of way had he still been on the roadway but he was in the crosswalk, a place where he was prohibited from proceeding on his bicycle. In that location, he did not have the right of way upon which he relies and therefore, this is really not a case of the defendant being in a servient position and the plaintiff being able to rely on that fact in contending that he should not also be held to be at fault. If he did not have the right of way, then in my opinion, the trial judge arrived at the correct conclusion when he found that his breach of that provision in the Motor Vehicle Act , R.S.B.C. 1979, c.288, deprived him of his claim of right of way and resulted in his being partly at fault for this collision. The plaintiff has contended that nothing he did was causative of the accident. It seems to me in placing himself in that position in relation to the defendant's truck he contributed to the accident. For those reasons I would dismiss the appeal. HUTCHEON, J.A.: I agree. LEGG, J.A.: I agree. HINKSON, J.A.: The appeal is dismissed. E.E.H.

Gibson Counsel for the Vancouver Sun D. Burnett Counsel for CKNW Place and Date of Hearing Vancouver, British Columbia December 14, 1992 Place and Date of Judgment Vancouver, British Columbia January 18, 1993 Written Reasons by: The Honourable Madam Justice Proudfoot (In Chambers) Court of Appeal for British Columbia Bruce Blackman - v. - Attorney General of British Columbia and Forensic Psychiatric Services Commission Reasons for Judgment of the Honourable Madam Justice Proudfoot (In Chambers) 1 This is an appeal from the British Columbia Board of Review pursuant to Section 672.72(1) of Part XX.1 of the Criminal Code . 2 The appellant applies for direction pursuant to Section 6(1)(d) of the Court of Appeal Act . 3 The appellant, Bruce Blackman, requested the British Columbia Board of Review to make an order excluding the public from his annual review under Section 672.5(6) of the Criminal Code . 4 The Board denied the exclusion order with a disposition stating that \"any evidence either written or oral given during the course of a hearing in which an application to exclude all or any member of the public is made cannot be the subject of an exclusion order\". 5 It is that order which Blackman appeals. 6 The issue whether this court has jurisdiction under Section 672.72(1) of the Criminal Code to entertain an appeal of a Review Board decision. 7 The decision of the Review Board was that evidence given during the course of a hearing of an application to exclude the public cannot be the subject of an exclusion order. 8 The court's jurisdiction must be found in Section 672.72(1) and that provision provides as follows: Any party may appeal against a disposition or placement decision made by a court or Review Board to the court of appeal of the province where the disposition or placement decision was made on any ground of appeal that raises a question of law or fact alone or mixed law and fact. 9 The ruling made by the Board must fall within the definition of either a \"disposition\" or a \"placement decision\". It can readily be seen that the ruling is not a \"placement decision\" as defined in Section 672.1. Is it then a \"disposition\"? 10 A disposition in Part XX.1 of the Criminal Code is an order made by the Review Board under Section 672.54 or an order made by a court under Section 672.58. The latter is not applicable. The former provides as follows: 672.54 Where a court or Review Board makes a disposition pursuant to subsection 672.45(2) or section 672.47, it shall, taking into consideration the need to protect the public from dangerous persons, the mental condition of the accused, the reintegration of the accused into society and the other needs of the accused, make one of the following dispositions that is the least onerous and least restrictive to the accused: (a) where a verdict of not criminally responsible on account of mental disorder has been rendered in respect of the accused and, in the opinion of the court or Review Board, the accused is not a significant threat to the safety of the public, by order, direct that the accused be discharged absolutely; (b) by order, direct that the accused be discharged subject to such conditions as the court or Review Board considers appropriate; or (c) by order, direct that the accused be detained in custody in a hospital, subject to such conditions as the court or Review Board considers appropriate. 11 In my view, it is clear that the order made by the Board does not fall into that section. That section clearly deals with either a discharge order or one that detains the applicant. A non-exclusion order, such as was made in the case at bar, does not deal with either a discharge or a detention. 12 The second ground the applicant advances, if I understand the argument, is that the final words of Section 672.72(1) \"any ground of appeal that raises a question of law or fact alone or of mixed law and fact\" expands the definition of disposition so as to include the type of ruling made by the Board, i.e., that certain evidence at the hearing of the Board of Review is not subject to a non-exclusion order. 13 I am not persuaded that the definition of disposition is expanded to the extent as argued by the appellant. These words set the parameters of the court's jurisdiction to hear appeals of the Review Board rulings. The appellate court's usual role is to review questions of law and not questions of fact (see the case of Prudential Trust Co. Ltd. v. Forseth , [1960] S.C.R. 210, 21 D.L.R. (2d) 587). Section 672.72.(1) simply makes it clear that an appeal of a \"disposition\" or \"placement decision\" is not confined to errors of law but may consist of questions of fact or mixed law and fact. It does not, in my view, in any way extend or expand the definition of a \"disposition\" or \"placement decision\". 14 The final argument the appellant makes is that Part XX.1 of the Criminal Code is not exclusively criminal and that accordingly, the Crown's authorities of Regina v. Needham (4 May 1992), Vancouver 013734 (B.C.C.A.) and Regina v. Lawrence (13 January 1992), Vancouver 014724 (B.C.C.A.) have no application. In my view, that argument cannot succeed. First, the law is clear that criminal appeals must find their origin in a statute. Authority for this is Regina v. Mills (1986), 26 C.C.C. (3d) 481 at 495. 15 Part XX.1 of the Criminal Code sets out the statutory procedure to deal with a person acquitted of a crime due to insanity. Although he or she may have been acquitted, these persons are nevertheless subject to spending a period of time in custody (in many instances, long periods of time) which Parliament has decided is an appropriate resolution. 16 The two cases put forward by the Crown support the proposition that this is a criminal matter and must be dealt with on a statutory level within Part XX.1 of the Criminal Code . 17 In the Needham case, several bans on publication were ordered during the course of a trial. The newspaper reporter filed a petition seeking the submissions and reasons for those orders. The petition was dismissed by the trial judge. The argument was that the petition commenced a \"civil proceeding\" and because the dismissal was a final order against the newspaper reporter, a right of appeal under Section 6(1) of the Court of Appeal Act was available. The Court of Appeal rejected that argument and concluded that the orders made during the course of a criminal trial, of an interlocutory nature and that an appeal was only available from a conviction or acquittal. 18 In Lawrence , the Crown appealed to the Court of Appeal an order made at a pre-hearing conference pursuant to Section 625.1(2) of the Criminal Code . Hinds, J.A., concluded that the pre-hearing conference \"was clearly a proceeding in respect of the indictable offences with which the respondents were charged\". It was an interlocutory order and the court could not entertain an appeal from that order. 19 In my view, the order made by the Review Board is an interlocutory order made as part of a criminal proceeding. Accordingly, the question of appealing that order must be determined by the statute specifically Part XX.1 of the Criminal Code , Section 672.72(1). 20 In conclusion, the Review Board decision is not a \"disposition\" or \"placement decision\" which can be appealed to this court within that section. 21 This court does not have jurisdiction to deal with this application. \"The Honourable Madam Justice Proudfoot\""},"meta":{},"created_at":"2022-03-12T00:56:03.261194Z","updated_at":"2022-03-12T05:07:12.816808Z","project":4},{"id":84,"annotations":[{"id":90,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"start":29,"end":65,"text":"Court of Appeal for British Columbia","labels":["COURT_NAME"]},"id":"7e8E-p4Mgs","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":116,"end":132,"text":"January 30, 1991"},"id":"DcQCuQIEQv","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":133,"end":155,"text":"MR.

JUSTICE MACFARLANE IN CHAMBERS Vancouver, B.C. BETWEEN: ATTORNEY GENERAL OF BRITISH COLUMBIA and HER MAJESTY THE QUEEN IN RIGHT OF THE PROVINCE OF BRITISH COLUMBIA PLAINTIFF (RESPONDENT) AND: CHIEF FRASER ANDREW, as representative of the Band Council and members of the Mount Currie Indian Band, MOUNT CURRIE INDIAN Band, and TERRI JOHN, RALPH DAN, RON DAN, ALVIN NELSON, ALBERT PASCAL and JOHN DOE as individuals and as representatives of persons blocking a road known as \"Lillooet Lake Road\" DEFENDANTS (APPELLANTS) Bruce Clark appearing for the Appellants, Terri John, Ralph Dan, Ron Dan, Alvin Nelson, Albert Pascal and John Doe Leslie Pinder appearing for the Appellants, Chief Fraser Andrew, as representative of the Band Council and members of the Mount Currie Indian Band D.M. Goldie, Q.C. and appearing for the Respondent J.M. MacKenzie (application for leave to appeal) MACFARLANE, J.A.: This is an application for leave to appeal an interlocutory injunction granted by Chief Justice Esson on October 30, 1990. The order provided inter alia : AND THIS COURT FURTHER ORDERS that until further Order of this Court, Chief Fraser Andrew and all other persons to whose notice this Order may come, are enjoined from obstructing or otherwise hindering the flow of traffic on Lillooet Lake Road (also known as \"Duffy Lake Road\" and \"Pemberton-Lillooet Road\"): AND THIS COURT FURTHER ORDERS that the undertaking normally required by Rule 45(6) is dispensed with: AND THIS COURT FURTHER ORDERS that all parties shall be at liberty to apply to this Honourable Court as to other matters which may arise in connection with this Order. It is to be noted that no order was made by Chief Justice Esson against these applicants, although they may be directly affected and probably are directly affected by it. Chief Justice Esson said on p.41 of his reasons: The order in the terms of Clauses 1 and 5 will be against Chief Andrew as representative of the Band Council and members of the Band. In view of the uncertainty as to service and as to the necessity for such an order, I make no order against the other defendants but that aspect of the application is adjourned. If the plaintiffs seek an injunction against those individuals, that may be spoken to. There will be liberty to apply as to other matters which may arise. On p.2 of his reasons Chief Justice Esson had said this with respect to the applicants: None of the individual defendants Terri John, Ralph Dan, Ron Dan, Alvin Nelson and Albert Pascal, have entered appearances. Some of them have not been served but I am satisfied that they are all aware of these proceedings. The applicants are said to have had notice of the injunction and to have disobeyed it. They are now facing contempt charges in a proceeding before Macdonald, J. They have never applied to set aside or vary the order of Chief Justice Esson and the question which they now raise has never been argued before Chief Justice Esson. It is submitted on behalf of the applicants that despite the fact that the matter has not been argued before Chief Justice Esson that when it was raised on a subsidiary application the Chief Justice said that the sovereignty question could not be supported in law. Counsel have also referred me to comments by Chief Justice Esson to the effect that the issue had not been argued before him and that he had not decided it. The applicants have now entered appearances and have filed a statement of defence and counter-claim in the trial proceedings. Counsel tells me that those pleadings raise the issue which is now put before me. No effort has been made to have the question of law based on those pleadings argued and decided at the trial level. The proposition which the applicants assert may be summarized in this way: The Supreme Court of British Columbia is without jurisdiction over the Lil'wat Aboriginal People (of which the applicants form part) because the Lil'wat People constitute a sovereign nation to which the laws of Canada do not apply and over which the Courts have no jurisdiction, specifically within the territory in question. Counsel for the applicants submits that the narrow question is whether s.8 of the Supreme Court Act applies to these applicants. In my view that must necessarily involve answering the Indian sovereignty question which I have just summarized. The motion before this Court also indicates that if leave be granted an application will be made to permit the appellants to adduce fresh evidence at the hearing of the appeal. But counsel for the applicants now asserts that this is a pure law issue not requiring evidence. Counsel for the Province submits that the applicants have no reasonable prospect of success on the sovereignty argument. He refers to R. v. Sparrow , (1989) 1 S.C.R. 1075 and particularly to what was said by Chief Justice Dickson at p.1103: It is worth recalling that while British policy towards the native population was based on respect for their right to occupy their traditional lands, a proposition to which the Royal Proclamation of 1763 bears witness, there was from the outset never any doubt that sovereignty and legislative power, and indeed the underlying title, to such lands vested in the Crown -- Counsel for the applicant submits that the jurisdictional issue and the Indian sovereignty question now raised has not been directly decided by the Supreme Court of Canada. Counsel for the respondent asserts that it is implicit in Sparrow that the Court held that Indian rights are a justiciable issue. Certainly the number of Indian rights cases that have gone to this Court and to the Supreme Court of Canada indicate that up until now the Indians involved in these cases had considered that the Courts had jurisdiction in matters pertaining to them. The merits of the issues raised by the applicants have been argued on this application but it is not necessary for me to decide the application on that basis. I would observe however that the proposition that Indians are not subject to the laws of Canada or to the jurisdiction of Canadian Courts is a novel one. Indians have been recognized as having special rights. Doubts over the interpretation of statutes are resolved in their favour. Some of their interests have been held to be paramount to others: See Sparrow . But, in the end they have always been regarded as citizens of Canada with all of the rights and obligations of citizens although they often assert, and sometimes correctly, that their rights have not always been properly recognized. How then can it be successfully argued that they are not subject to the laws of Canada and to the jurisdiction of our Courts? I need not answer the question. There is no doubt that if the argument has any chance of success it is one of great complexity involving a consideration of the origins of the people involved and a historical analysis which undoubtedly give rise to conflicting expert opinions. The solicitor for the Lil'wat Aboriginal People says in an affidavit that her client's case rests on a book by Bruce Clark, now counsel for the applicants. The book, Native Liberty, Crown Sovereignty: The Existing Aboriginal Right of Self-Government in Canada (Montreal and Kingston, McGill - Queen's University Press, 1990), which is 203 pages in length and contains an extensive appendix, bibliography, and index is a clear indication of the complexity of the subject. But, it is a thesis which will inevitably be attacked by other experts whose opinions will have to be taken into account before this issue is resolved. In my opinion, the proper place for that to be done is in the trial court. Mr. Goldie for the Provincial Crown suggests that the issue may be resolved on an application to set aside or vary the order in question. If the question can proceed on agreed facts and involves only a point of law it may be set down as such. If it requires evidence which needs to be considered at trial then it may be dealt with in that fashion. I do not suggest what procedure may be appropriate but I think that the question is one to which the trial process should be applied. The danger of deciding constitutional questions at the interlocutory stage was discussed in Manitoba (Attorney General) v. Metropolitan Stores Limited (1987) 1 S.C.R. 110 at 130-133. The essential need to establish the factual basis in the Charter cases was emphasised in MacKay v. Manitoba [1989] 2 S.C.R. 357 at 361-3. At p.361-2, Mr. Justice Cory said this: Charter decisions should not and must not be made in a factual vacuum. To attempt to do so would trivialize the Charter and inevitably result in ill-considered opinions. The presentation of facts is not, as stated by the respondent, a mere technicality; rather, it is essential to a proper consideration of Charter issues. A respondent cannot, by simply consenting to dispense with the factual background, require or expect a court to deal with an issue such as this in a factual void. Charter decisions cannot be based upon the unsupported hypotheses of enthusiastic counsel. The need to ensure a proper factual foundation exists in Charter cases was discussed further in Danson v. Ontario (Attorney General) (1990); 112 N.R. 362 at 375-379. In that case, Mr. Justice Sopinka quoted what I have just taken from Mr. Justice Cory's judgment in MacKay and also had regard to other portions of his opinion. I recognize that a firm factual basis is needed in Charter cases and particularly before a s.1 analysis is undertaken. That need is not to be found in this case, but the caution expressed in Metropolitan Stores is not limited to Charter or constitutional cases but to all decisions at the interlocutory stage. In this case we are dealing with the granting of an interlocutory injunction. Serious constitutional questions are said to arise if the applicants press the point that they have argued before me. If that is so then any decision must be carefully considered as it will profoundly affect the lives of Canadians and all residents of Canada: MacKay v. Manitoba . In particular, the concept of Indian sovereignty, depending as it must, on historical analysis and documentary interpretation must to a great extent, I think, depend upon evidence. The proper way in which to develop the appropriate background for the consideration of the question is to be found in applying the trial process. For those reasons I would refuse leave to appeal.

LaBelle Counsel for the defendant\/applicant: B. McNeill 1 The defendant applies pursuant to s. 62 of the Family Relations Act for an order varying the amount of child support payable for the child of the marriage, Ryan, who is in the custody of the plaintiff. The order sought to be varied is that of Mr. Justice Mazko of June 18, 1992. The defendant says that there have been significant changes in his circumstances since the making of that order; namely, he now has custody of the two children of his first marriage, his business which was not thriving has been sold to his present wife whom he married in July 1993, and most significantly, he suffered a heart attack in December 1993 and has not been able to work since. By my rough reckoning this is the third or fourth application made by the defendant to vary; it certainly is not the fourth or fifth time the parties have been in court over the subject of support. There have been a number of appearances to enforce the payment of support in Provincial court. 2 The history of the orders can be briefly summarized. May 11, 1990 by consent, the parties agreed to the sum of $500 a month for the interim support of Ryan. Thereafter the parties entered into minutes of settlement which provided for the payment of that sum until further agreement or court order with the terms of the minutes of settlement to be incorporated into an order of the Supreme Court \"as a term of the divorce order in any petition for divorce proceedings commenced by the plaintiff or the defendant\". When the action under the Family Relations Act was heard in 1992, the only issue was the amount of child support, at least as I read the oral reasons for judgment of Mazko, J. It appears the defendant applied to reduce the amount of support based in part upon a medical condition [cancer] and the decline in the profitability of his business. Mazko, J. was clearly of the view that the amount of support was appropriate. He was equally satisfied that the defendant had not discharged the burden upon him to satisfy the court that there had been a significant change in his circumstances since the making of the 1990 order. The defendant brought on another application to vary in July 1993 and filed materials in support. That application did not proceed due to the heart attack the defendant suffered in December 1993. That application seems to have simply been adjourned generally or abandoned. There is no indication that the term of the Minutes of Settlement requiring that the support provision be incorporated into a divorce judgment was complied with; certainly it appears the parties were divorced as the defendant remarried in July 1993 following a brief period of a \"common law\" relationship with Sharnell Muir beginning in January 1993. Ms. Muir was and is a dentist. At the time their relationship began, she had a practice in Langley which she sold in February 1993 when the defendant and she decided to relocate to the Okanagan where the majority of the defendant's business was. The new wife of the defendant was not able to obtain any work other than for two weeks as a locum in October of 1993. In February she opened her own practice. Her 1993 net income appears to have been $114,000 for that is the amount shown on the defendant's 1993 T-1 tax return. His employment income for the same period was $6750 due, he says, to a slump in his business. He deposes that he was obliged to borrow sums of money from Ms. Muir, such that in the summer of 1994 he signed a demand promissory note dated August 15 in the amount of $55,272.10 in favour of Ms. Muir. The particulars of the money borrowed are set out in the note which acknowledges a loan or loans from her during the period February 1993 to July 1994 of approximately $22,440. These loans he says, were necessary in order for him to meet his living expenses. The plaintiff points to the fact that with the sale of the defendant's home in Maple Ridge in September 1992, he had a credit balance of $25,650 remaining after making a deposit of $40,000 for the new home and paying off substantial debts owing to his former wives. There was and is no explanation of the use of this sum of money yet the defendant deposes that he was obliged to start borrowing from his new wife some four or five months later in February 1993. By the time he swore his affidavit on November 15, 1993, the defendant deposed that he was indebted to his wife, Ms. Muir, in the sum of $6,940. By August 15, 1994, nine months later, the debt had increased by roughly $15,000. There was no underlying documentation to support or explain this. The total debt was, in part, the consideration for the transfer of the defendant's interest in the Mara property to his wife, Ms. Muir. 3 In any event the defendant deposes to the fact that with the settlement he and the plaintiff arrived at in August 1994, he satisfied a portion of the debt owing to Ms. Muir by transferring to her his interest in their home. There now remains owing on that debt the sum of $7500. 4 The material discloses that the defendant attempted to sell his business in 1992 without success. He had bought out the plaintiff's interest with the settlement in 1990 and he was the sole shareholder. Finally, in February 1993, he sold his interest in the business to Ms. Muir for $8,000 and entered into an employment contract with the company. The terms of his remuneration set out in the contract, require the company to pay him a percentage of the profits of the company. I am not clear whether the remuneration is as set out in the typewritten portion or that which has been handwritten into the contract; the amendment has been initialled by the defendant but not by Ms. Muir. In the event it is the amended figure, it requires the company to pay him 10% of the net profit of the company after tax but before management bonus, payable within six months of the company's year end which is the last day of February. The last financial statements are for the period ending February 28, 1993 almost two years ago, and thus there is no current information from the defendant's employer whether there are any profits, nor for that matter, whether the company has had any revenues. In brief, I do not know what precisely are the financial affairs of the company. I am aware that the affidavits of Mr. Hagen depose that he is not capable of working for the company and that a licensed operator is required by a pesticide operator, but the material falls short of satisfying me that the defendant is incapable of performing any work, either for the company or otherwise, or that some efforts have been made to continue with the operations of the company using hired help supervised or directed by the defendant. The plaintiff is entitled to be suspicious that, with the professional practice of the defendant's wife, he may be content to be more leisurely in the pursuit of employment. 5 Nor am I satisfied that there has been the kind of complete and reliable disclosure needed to justify the making of the order sought. Some examples will be sufficient to demonstrate my concern. 6 The defendant swore two Property and Financial Statements detailing his circumstances as of the month of October 1994. The first was for the use of this court on the hearing of this application. The other was for the use in Vernon in the defendant's application for an order that his first wife pay child support for their two children presently living with him. The two statements were sworn twenty days apart. The first deposes to total monthly expenses of $3,400 while the second deposes to total monthly expenses of $4,370. The first does not disclose any income whatsoever while the second shows his present wife's income at $3,400. There is a $1,000 difference between the two in the value shown for general household items. The first shows debts and liabilities of $20,180 while the second shows the debts at $12,242. Finally, the statement in support of this application discloses the disposition of the primary residence in Maple Ridge and the transfer of his half interest in the Mara property, while the second statement discloses only the disposition of his company. Each inconsistency is significant. At the very least it erodes the confidence which I ought to have when considering the evidence of the applicant. 7 Next, when the defendant made application in the fall of 1993, he deposed in his affidavit sworn in July 1993 (filed October 26, 1993) that he was currently living with his common law spouse, a \"dentist and ... currently not practising [sic]\". The affidavit sworn October 1, 1994 deposes that his wife sold her Langley practice in February 1993 and she did not work as a dentist from January 1993 until October 1993 as no work was available for her other than a brief locum for two weeks in October 1993, and that she opened her own practice in February 1994. The clear implication to be drawn from either affidavit is that there was a significant financial burden being born by the defendant and his new wife. However, when the defendant made his application in Vernon earlier referred to, he attached his last three income tax returns. Page 3 of the 1993 return showed his wife's net income as $114,280. This return was not originally filed on this application by the defendant. Rather, it was an exhibit to the affidavit filed on behalf of the plaintiff. Only after that did the defendant attach a copy as an exhibit to his affidavit in reply, filed December 8, 1994. In explanation he deposed that he had thought it had been filed by his previous solicitor. 8 Lastly, the material in support of the averment that he is medically incapable of working, falls short of what is required in a case contested as vigorously as this one is. The first memorandum of his condition is contained in a prescription slip written by his general practitioner. The second and only slightly longer \"report\" was attached as an exhibit to his November 22, 1994 affidavit. It reports of intermittent episodes of angina, particularly on stress or exertion and of a test done in July 1994. The diagnosis is of a triple vessel disease but no critical stenosis of any of the vessels. His doctor felt he was still at risk and that she did not feel \"it was wise for him to return to work until such time as he has been symptom free for several months \" [my underlining]. I know that this matter was to proceed several times before it was finally referred to me last week, but several months have passed since the letter, and in any event, it is not as informative as it should be. Counsel for the plaintiff notes that it does not comply with the requirements of the Evidence Act , it makes no reference to other procedures and examinations conducted and it does not state when the last symptom was experienced. 9 The position of the plaintiff may briefly be summarized as follows: the defendant has not made out a case demonstrating a significant change in circumstances and the material filed in support of the application raises more questions than it answers. The plaintiff says that the financial information of the defendant's wife is relevant and the case law requires that the non- custodial parent seeking a subsistence reduction must be prepared to suffer a reduction in his\/her standard of living before that of the child. The plaintiff relies upon Levesque v. Levesque ; Birmingham v. Birmingham , [1994] 8 W.W.R. 589 , Alberta Court of Appeal. The defendant replies that Levesque is essentially dicta insofar as the reference to income of cohabitants, and that this court is bound to follow R. v. R. , Vancouver Registry No. A892673 , Spencer, J. March 21, 1994 on the basis of judicial comity [Re Hansard Spruce Mills, Ltd. [1954] 4 D.L.R. 590] . 10 In R. v. R. , Spencer J. stated: The second wife is, of course, not required to support the children of the first marriage, but her presence may be considered to the extent that she assists, or should assist, the father by contributing to their shared costs of living. 11 I do not find that statement to be at odds with the statements of the Alberta Court of Appeal in Levesque . I agree with that court when it holds that poverty, if there is to be poverty, must be shared, but the parents must pick up most of the slack. At p. 605 the court observed: It follows that any subsistence adjustment would not drive the award paid so low that the subsistence level of the other parent, or the child, falls below that of the parent seeking the adjustment. 12 On the facts of this application as I perceive them, I am not satisfied that were I to accede to the defendant's application, that would not be the result. The Alberta Court of Appeal reiterates well settled law that a person seeking to vary an award must make the fullest disclosure and demonstrate that there is no unavoidable expense [see also Longstaffe v. Longstaffe , (1994) 86 B.C.L.R.(2d) 1 ]. The court also urges other judges to review other relevant factors, including: (ii) The judge should examine other sources of assistance in fact available to the party asking for an adjustment, including not only social services and new spouses , but also the extended family of each parent and the child. It is at this point that the income of cohabitants becomes relevant. (iii) The general principle is that maintenance is payable before debts.... (iv) The judge should keep in mind that any reduction in the living standard of the custodial parent can lead to a reduction in the living standard of the child.... 13 All of these factors have a play in the application before me. The defendant has remarried and his wife is a professional with a practice of her own. I have no knowledge of her circumstances other than the bald statement that her income is $3,400. A court is entitled to have disclosure of a second spouses fortune estate and prospects when being asked to vary a support order. There are a number of benefits available to a sole practitioner which are not taxable but go a long way to improving the day to day standard of living. These details should, in my view, be available to the chambers judge. Further, I am satisfied that at this moment in time, with the plaintiff concluding her retraining and being dependant upon her rental income, savings and loans from her parents for tuition and living expenses, as well as the support payable by the defendant, any reduction in the child support would lead to a reduction in the standard of living of the child. I am not satisfied on this material that such a reduction in the standard is warranted, particularly where, as part of a settlement of the arrears last summer, the defendant paid a lump sum of money to the plaintiff sufficient to pay the child support until June of 1995. In that sense the application is somewhat premature. In any event, the lack of adequate medical evidence of the defendant's condition, together with insufficient particulars of his spouse's financial circumstances, including the financial statements of the company, warrant that this application be dismissed. Should there be more complete evidence then, of course, the defendant is at liberty to reapply in the summer of 1995. 14 The plaintiff is entitled to her costs of this application. \"Warren, J.\" January 12, 1995 Vancouver, British Columbia"},"meta":{},"created_at":"2022-03-12T00:56:03.260624Z","updated_at":"2022-03-12T01:33:18.555711Z","project":4},{"id":101,"annotations":[{"id":107,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"start":29,"end":65,"text":"Court of Appeal for British Columbia","labels":["COURT_NAME"]},"id":"D5bI1HdF6t","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":75,"end":114,"text":"CANADA MORTGAGE AND HOUSING CORPORATION","labels":["PERS_RESPONDENT"]},"id":"KukKOtZDdP","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":131,"end":156,"text":"WESTSEA CONSTRUCTION LTD.","labels":["PERS_APPELLANT"]},"id":"5CyanICsJy","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":158,"end":192,"text":"CAPITAL CONSTRUCTION SUPPLIES LTD.","labels":["PERS_APPELLANT"]},"id":"n-rk-dnFLc","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":194,"end":221,"text":"WEST PARK DEVELOPMENTS LTD.","labels":["PERS_APPELLANT"]},"id":"Tg7fkUZKVf","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":226,"end":253,"text":"VIEW TOWERS PROPERTIES LTD.","labels":["PERS_APPELLANT"]},"id":"iC5QDYO41v","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":273,"end":307,"text":"The Honourable Mr. Justice Taggart","labels":["PERS_JUDGE"]},"id":"d8rrFD4Sk4","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":308,"end":338,"text":"The Honourable Mr. Justice Toy","labels":["PERS_JUDGE"]},"id":"Jd2CwySqoE","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":339,"end":377,"text":"The Honourable Madam Justice Proudfoot","labels":["PERS_JUDGE"]},"id":"8GH1dHo1wT","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":378,"end":397,"text":"Lawrence M.

The mortgage was granted on April 23, 1970 to secure a loan of $3,615,358.00 which West Park used to construct a low rental housing project in Victoria. Interest was payable at 6 and 7\/8 percent per annum calculated half-yearly not in advance as well after as before maturity. January 1, 1971 was fixed as the interest adjustment date. Thereafter the principal and interest were payable in monthly instalments of $21,142.42 commencing on February 1, 1971 and ending on January 1, 2021. Arrears of principal and interest were to bear compound interest at 6 and 7\/8 percent. If the mortgagor was not in default then on the fifteenth anniversary of the interest adjustment date, or thereafter on any monthly instalment payment date, it could pay the whole or any part of the principal and interest owing. A bonus of three months interest on the amount then owing was charged for the privilege of prepaying. On June 1, 1970 the parties entered into an operating agreement which set out the basis upon which the mortgage would be managed. The agreement confirmed the obligation of the mortgagor to make payment of principal and interest; and its entitlement to prepay the amount due for principal and interest on and after the fifteenth anniversary of the interest adjustment date. West Park transferred title to the property to Westsea Construction Ltd. (Westsea) which, as were the other defendants, was owned or controlled by one man. Nothing appears to turn on the inter-corporate relationships of the defendants. Westsea discharged its obligation to make the monthly mortgage payments by sending the plaintiff before the end of each year twelve post-dated cheques for the payments to be made in the following year. The fifteenth anniversary of the interest adjustment date fell on January 1, 1986. Before the end of 1985 Westsea sent the plaintiff twelve post-dated cheques for the 1986 mortgage payments. On October 9, 1986 the plaintiff wrote Westsea saying that the fifteen year \"lock-in\" period of the mortgage had expired on October 1, 1986; that because of defaults in the operating agreement the balance owing under the mortgage was due; and demanding payment of $3,400,284.45 which was said to be the amount due on October 15, 1986 with a per diem of $629.73 thereafter. That letter was followed by one of November 20, 1986 advising Westsea its twelve post-dated cheques for 1986 would be used up in December and asking for a new series of post-dated cheques. Westsea sent the plaintiff twelve post-dated cheques for 1987. On January 5, 1987 the plaintiff's solicitors returned the twelve cheques for 1987; advised Westsea the plaintiff was no longer accepting post-dated cheques; and suggested Westsea discuss with Mr. Kilner of the plaintiff's Vancouver office arrangements for repayment of the mortgage. Nothing further appears to have happened until April 14, 1987 when the plaintiff wrote to West Park (misstating its name as West Part) advising the latter of the state of the mortgage account which was said to be in arrears to the extent of $63,427.26. That was the amount of the January, February and March 1987 payments. Westsea sent the plaintiff three cheques each in the amount of $21,142.42 to pay the arrears. The plaintiff did not cash the cheques but retained possession of them. A much longer interval of silence ensued. Finally on February 27, 1990 the plaintiff began this action alleging breaches of the operating agreement and seeking relief of various kinds including an order requiring West Park to comply with the provisions of the operating agreement. On March 1, 1990 Westsea wrote the plaintiff saying it wished to pay out the mortgage and asking for a payout statement. No reply was received so on March 8th the solicitors for Westsea sent the solicitors for the plaintiff a bank draft for $4,135,975.91. That sum was calculated in accordance with the terms of the plaintiff's letter of October 9, 1986. The draft was sent in final payment of any amount owing on the mortgage and on condition that Westsea be provided with a registrable discharge of the mortgage. The letter and draft were returned and two further efforts to pay out the mortgage were rebuffed. There followed an exchange of correspondence which resulted in the mortgage being paid off and the sum of $149,946.48 being paid into court by Westsea. That sum is made up of $57,571.23 claimed by the plaintiff for the three months bonus and $92,375.25 claimed for compound interest. Since each party claimed the entire sum the dispute was referred to a judge in chambers for resolution. The judge reviewed the relevant authorities including Brown v. Cole (1845), 14 Sim. 427, 60 E.R. 424; Bovill v. Endle , [1896] 1 Ch. 648 (Ch.D.); Smith v. Smith , [1891] 3 Ch. 550 (Ch.D.); Browne v. Lockhart (1840), 10 Sim. 420, 59 E.R. 678; Cameo Developments Ltd. v. National Life Assurance Company of Canada (1984), 56 B.C.L.R. 363 (C.A.); Prudential Insurance Company of America v. Hollyburn Properties (Alberta) Ltd. (1985), 58 B.C.L.R. 211 (C.A.); Re Shankman and Mutual Life Ass. Co. (1986), 21 D.L.R. (4th) 131 (Ont. C.A.); and Chang v. Brown (1977), 2 B.C.L.R. 65 (S.C.). As he did before the chambers judge, counsel for the defendants urged us to rely on the October 1986 demand by the plaintiff for payment of the amount due on the mortgage. He argued that the authorities precluded the plaintiff from relying on the provisions of the operating agreement relating to the payment of a bonus. In rejecting that argument the judge said: The demand was made back in October, 1986. A mortgagor seeking to exercise an equitable right should have \"accepted\" that demand long before the spring of 1990. C.M.H.C. never took any effective steps to enforce the demand and by passage of time it simply withered away; alternatively, it was, if still in existence, extinguished by the commencement of this action on February 27, 1990 which clearly is not a step to compel a payment of the whole of the mortgage debt but to protect the security. Counsel relied on Edmondson v. Copland , [1911] 2 Ch. 301 (Ch. D.), to justify the very long delay by Westsea in raising as a defence the effect of the obvious mistake by the plaintiff in making the demand. I do not think that case assists the defendants. There was no error in the conclusion of the chambers judge that in the circumstances of this case the plaintiff is entitled to claim the three months bonus. The defendants challenged the decision of the judge that the plaintiff was entitled to compound interest contending that Westsea made an appropriate tender to the plaintiff when it sent the plaintiff the twelve post-dated cheques in October 1986. On this aspect the judge said: In the matter of the compound interest Mr. Candido submits that the defendant was never at any time in arrears and, therefore, C.M.H.C. is not entitled to compound interest pursuant to clause 6. He says that when in reply to C.M.H.C.'s letter of November 20, 1986 Westsea sent C.M.H.C. twelve cheques for the year 1987 there was a good tender by Westsea and the rule is clear that where a debtor is obliged to pay a specific sum of money to a creditor and the debtor makes a valid tender which the creditor unjustifiably refuses, although the debt remains the tender bars any claim for interest or damages after the tender. He says that here the defendants have paid the ordinary interest but because of the tender cannot be compelled to pay the compound interest. I have no hesitation in finding that there was no tender by the defendants. What they did was attempt to take advantage of what was clearly a lack of communication between the several departments of C.M.H.C. The letter of January 5, 1987 from C.M.H.C.'s solicitors to Westsea made it very clear what the position of C.M.H.C. was. Furthermore if, as the defendants have maintained, there was made by C.M.H.C. in October, 1986 a demand for payment of the whole, the sending of twelve post-dated cheques for the year 1987 is not a tender in reply to that demand. In any event for a plea of tender to be successful in barring a creditor from entitlement to interest, there must be evidence that the debtor set aside the tendered sum and that set aside sum remains ready for payment at any time ( Barratt v. Gough Thomas (1951), 2 All E.R. 48). There was no evidence before me that any sum or sums were ever set aside by the plaintiffs [sic: defendants]. The plea of tender fails and I hold that C.M.H.C. is entitled to payment by way of compound interest of the sum of $92,375.35 [sic: $92,375.25]. Again I see no error on the part of the judge. On the contrary I think he reached the only conclusion open to him on the evidence before him. Westsea raised two subsidiary issues concerning the burden of proof and legal as opposed to equitable remedies. The burden of proof issue arises because the judge referred to it when dealing with the defendants' submissions with respect to bonus. As I read his reasons the judge used the expression \"burden of proof\" in relation to the defendants only in the sense that he who asserts a proposition must sustain it. The judge was clearly of the view the defendants had not met that test and I agree they did not. The judge referred to the equitable right which the defendants sought to enforce in the first passage from his judgment set out above. I agree with the submission of counsel for the plaintiff that in essence what the defendants were asserting was their equitable right to redeem their title. I can find no error in what the judge said. The defendants' submissions based on the Interest Act were abandoned. In my opinion the remaining submissions fail for the reasons I have stated and for the reasons given by the chambers judge with which I agree. I would dismiss the appeal. \"THE HONOURABLE MR.

Nichols Counsel for the Defendants: Don Baron Place and Date of Trial: Vancouver, B.C. 3 - 5 January 1995 INTRODUCTION 1 Fred Derosa is a copywriter. Okanagan Skeena Group Ltd. (Skeena) broadcasts radio and television programs in Terrace, B.C. In 1990, it had about 60 employees. At all material times, Sharon Taylor was the person in charge of Personnel and Administration for Skeena at its Terrace offices. 2 In April 1990, Skeena hired Mr. DeRosa as head of the Copy Department. Differences arose between him and Skeena as to the terms of his employment. Mr. DeRosa claims that Skeena did not allow him to conduct his work as it promised. On 17 August 1990, he submitted his letter of resignation dated 6 August 1990. 3 In his statement of claim he alleges that Skeena and Ms. Taylor made pre-hiring promises and representations to him that amounted to fraudulent or negligent misrepresentations. He now seeks from them an award of general, special, aggravated and punitive damages. His total damage claim except for special damages is alleged to be in the range of $10,000.00. His special damages involve moving expenses. They amount to $6,695.60. He does not claim damages for wrongful or constructive dismissal. 4 The defendants deny liability. They also contend that the plaintiff is prevented from succeeding on his claim for at least two reasons. First, on 9 July 1991, he brought an action in the Provincial Court - Small Claims Division against Skeena for essentially the same cause of action and lost. Skeena says this creates an issue estoppel and the dispute is res judicata . 5 Second, Mr. DeRosa was a member of a union covered by a collective agreement while he was an employee of Skeena. That agreement provided for the arbitration of any complaint or claim brought by an employee concerning working conditions. Mr. DeRosa did not invoke the provisions of the collective agreement. Instead, he elected to sue both defendants. Because the dispute was arbitrable under the collective agreement, the defendants argue that the court lacks jurisdiction. 6 Skeena also counterclaims for damages against Mr. DeRosa on the grounds of abuse of process. FACTS 7 Mr. DeRosa was 41 years old in the spring of 1990. He was living in the Toronto area. On 10 March 1990, he sent a letter to Skeena seeking employment. On 27 March 1990, Ms. Taylor replied to the letter by way of a telephone call. Ms. Taylor and Mr. DeRosa discussed his qualifications and his ideas for changing the operation of Skeena's Copy Department. After checking with her superiors, Ms. Taylor called back a few days later and offered the job to Mr. DeRosa. He accepted. 8 On 3 April 1990, Ms. Taylor sent Mr. DeRosa a letter of confirmation. The relevant part reads: Your past experience with the Columbine system will be a great asset, and as promised, you will be free to set up the system to your specifications so that there is a tight control on facilities orders and carts. I don't anticipate any problems in turning this over to your department. 9 The plaintiff took this letter and other alleged pre-contractual verbal assurances as a commitment that he could organize and administer the Copy Department the way he desired. In his statement of claim he alleges that Skeena agreed he would be in charge of and have authority to implement an administrative system for the Copy Department of Skeena to his specifications. 10 The defendants say that no such promise was ever made. They admit that Skeena agreed to transfer certain responsibilities from the Traffic Department to the Copy Department but they deny they agreed to give him a completely free hand to operate as he pleased. 11 Nonetheless, in May of 1990 Skeena gave him the opportunity of designing and implementing his own system. After a short try out, Skeena found it didn't work. Other Departments of Skeena that had to coordinate their activities with the Copy Department complained. The system was then restored to its previous arrangement except for a few variations designed to accommodate the wishes of the plaintiff. 12 Mr. DeRosa continued working for Skeena but he was an unhappy man. On 17 August 1990 he tendered his resignation. In that letter he said: I am leaving because I feel that my philosophies on running a radio station creative department are not suitable for the particular demands and requirements of Skeena Broadcasters. 13 He did not complain in the letter that the defendants failed to live up to any pre-hiring commitments. 14 Skeena still tried to salvage the situation. It wished to retain Mr. DeRosa as a valued employee. It asked him to put in writing the changes he would like to make. He did so. Mr. DeRosa, representatives of Skeena management and personnel from associated Departments got together and discussed his proposals. Unfortunately, they could not reach a consensus. Mr. DeRosa then confirmed his resignation, but he agreed to stay on with the company until it found a replacement. On 19 October 1990 he left for good. 15 While Mr. DeRosa worked for Skeena he was a member of the National Association of Broadcast Employees and Technicians - CLC (NABET). NABET had a collective agreement with Skeena during that time period. It provided for the settlement of disputes between employees and the company by way of a grievance and arbitration procedure. The relevant clause reads in part as follows: 7.1 \"Grievance\" shall mean any complaint or claim brought by an employee ... concerning ... work or working conditions... 16 The collective agreement goes on to describe the machinery for resolving such disputes by way of arbitration. 17 On 19 July 1991, Mr. DeRosa filed a Notice of Claim in the Terrace Registry of the Provincial Court of British Columbia (Small Claims Court). He named Skeena as the defendant. He described his claim against Skeena in these words: The claimant was offered employment with the Skeena Broadcasters Division of Okanagan Skeena Group Limited on or about 29 March 1990. The claimant made such personal and financial sacrifices to reach the job site in Terrace to accept the position offered. The job did not conform to what was originally promised. The claimant would not have accepted the job had he known what it would be. Mr. DeRosa then claimed damages as follows: a) moving expenses $4,076.18 Toronto to Terrace b) net loss of income 2,727.40 Total $6,803.58 18 In a letter to the Canada Labour Relations Board dated 19 April 1992, Mr. DeRosa stated: I decided to sue the company for breach of contract and misrepresentation. I pursued my case through the small claims court... 19 The Small Claims Court judge dismissed his claim. The court order dated 19 February 1992 reads in part: This court orders: This claim is dismissed. No jurisdiction in this court; Mr. DeRosa has not established that there was a breach of contract. No order of costs in favour of the defendant. 20 Mr. DeRosa then brought this action in the Supreme Court. Essentially, he relies on the same grounds that he put forward in his suit in the Small Claims Court. ANALYSIS 21 Mr. DeRosa's claim depends upon his version of the pre-contractual oral discussions between Ms. Taylor as well as the Skeena letter of 3 April 1990. If his interpretation of these matters is rejected his action must fail. It would remain as simply a situation where he was hired, became unhappy with his job and quit. If he is believed, then he may have the right to recover damages from the defendants. See for example: Wainwright et al . v. Vancouver Shipyards Co, Ltd. et al . (1987), 14 B.C.L.R. (2d) 247 (B.C.C.A.); Johnston v. Dresser Industries Ltd . (1990), 75 O.R. (2d) 609 (Ont. C.A.), etc. 22 The burden of proof is on Mr. DeRosa to prove three ingredients on a balance of probabilities. First, that the long-distance telephone calls and the letter of 3 April 1990 amounted to a pre-hiring contract between him and Skeena. Second, that in those calls and the letter, the parties agreed he would be in charge of Copy Department at Terrace and he would be free to implement an administrative system to his specifications. Third, that the pre-hiring oral or written representations of Ms. Taylor and Skeena were made fraudulently or negligently. 23 The evidence relating to the pre-employment long-distance telephone calls falls well short of proving the agreement alleged by the plaintiff. Ms. Taylor and Mr. DeRosa had never met before. It seems unreasonable to suppose that Skeena would give the plaintiff the broad authority he says he received in these one or two pre-contractual long-distance telephone calls when no one in the Terrace office of Skeena even knew him. All they had was a copy of his resume or application for employment. 24 The essence of Skeena's operations was that each department worked in cooperation with the others. Unless management agreed, one could not dictate to the others. If the argument of Mr. DeRosa is accepted in its literal form, he had the right to devise a scheme for the Copy Department regardless of the effect it had on other departments. Why would Skeena agree to putting the operation of the Copy Department into the hands of an unknown such as Mr. DeRosa and accepting the outcome, whatever that might be? 25 At the time of the telephone conversations, Mr. DeRosa had never been to Terrace. He knew nothing about Skeena's physical plant. He had little information concerning its overall operating procedures. In these circumstances it seems unreasonable that he would commit himself to successfully operating the Copy Department when he knew or should have known much would depend upon company policies and the way other departments performed their work. 26 I was impressed with the evidence of Ms. Taylor. She struck me as an honest and fair administrator. She and Skeena went to great lengths to try and meet the demands of Mr. DeRosa. However, they refused to agree to any of his suggestions which they knew from past experience would probably fail. Wherever there is a difference in the evidence between the testimony of Mr. DeRosa and that of Ms. Taylor, I accept her evidence over his. Consequently, I am unable to find that in the pre-hiring telephone conversations Skeena agreed that Mr. DeRosa would be free to implement an administrative system in the Copy Department to his specifications. 27 Left for consideration is the letter of 3 April 1990. The letter does not appear to be a document containing pre-hiring representations outside the actual offer of employment. Rather, it seems to be the offer of employment itself. The letter is somewhat ambiguous because the second sentence in the paragraph qualifies the first. In the first sentence, Skeena offers to give Mr. DeRosa the right to manage the Copy Department \"so that there is a tight control on facilities orders and carts.\" By itself the commitment is vague and uncertain. Nothing in the letter suggests that Mr. DeRosa will have the unfettered authority to implement an administrative system in the Copy Department to his specifications. Finally, the second sentence qualifies the offer in these words: \"I don't anticipate any problems in turning this over to your department.\" 28 What the letter apparently amounts to, is an offer by Skeena to Mr. DeRosa that he could set up a system to his specifications in the Copy Department allowing for tight control of facilities orders and carts, unless unanticipated problems arose. By his conduct Mr. DeRosa accepted the offer and went to work for Skeena. Unanticipated problems did arise when Mr. DeRosa attempted to implement his system. Thus, Skeena had the right to withdraw any commitment it made to Mr. DeRosa about his right to exercise tight control over facilities orders and carts. 29 By itself, the letter might have been grounds for a claim of constructive dismissal if one had been made. But even then, such a claim likely would have failed since the letter does not contain an unqualified promise to Mr. DeRosa that he would be allowed to implement an administrative system in the Copy Department to his specifications. The letter is also consistent with the evidence of Ms. Taylor concerning the contents of the pre-hiring telephone conversations. 30 Given these findings, neither Ms. Taylor nor Skeena made any negligent or fraudulent misrepresentations to Mr. DeRosa. Therefore, it is not necessary to determine whether the defences apply of estoppel by res judicata , and lack of jurisdiction by reason of the collective agreement. As to issue estoppel, see for example: Grewal v. Small et al . (1985), 69 B.C.L.R. 121 (B.C.S.C); Nesbitt Thomson Deacon Inc . v. Everett (1989), 37 B.C.L.R. (2d) 341 (B.C.C.A.); Evans v. Campbell (1993), 77 B.C.L.R. (2d) 211 (B.C.C.A.), etc. As to lack of jurisdiction, see for example: Queen v. Cognos Inc . (1993), 45 C.C.E.L. 153 (S.C.C.); Ontario (Attorney General) v. Bowie (1993), 1 C.C.E.L. (2d) 190 (Ont. Court of Justice); Steer v. Aerovox (1984), 5 C.C.E.L. 130 (Nova Scotia Supreme Court); Canada Labour Code , s.57, etc. 31 With respect to the counterclaim, counsel did not cite any authority to me that holds the use of the court system by a litigant amounts to an abuse of process giving a remedy in damages. A person who brings an unsuccessful action can be penalized in costs. Apart from exceptional circumstances, costs are the remedy for the successful party, not damages in a counter-suit for abuse of process. 32 Because both the action and the counterclaim are dismissed, my preliminary view is that each side should bear their own costs. But I will hear submissions from counsel on the point if they are unable to agree. JUDGMENT 33 1. The action and the counter-claim are dismissed. 2. Each side will bear their own costs. \"J.C.

JUSTICE MACKOFF ) DEFENDANT ) ) Counsel for the Plaintiff: G.V.R. Keirstead Counsel for the Defendant: A.C. Ward Dates and Place of Trial: October 1 & 2, 1992 Vancouver, B.C. The plaintiff, who is now 48 years of age, claims damages for injuries sustained in a motor vehicle accident. On December 28, 1989 at approximately 7:00 p.m., the plaintiff and his wife were in their automobile travelling east on Gilpin Avenue in Burnaby on their way to visit a friend who lived on that street. They had never been to the friend's house before. In order to enable him to find the address, which was across the street, Mr. Dha told his wife, who was driving, to pull over onto the shoulder of the road. She did so in mid block. The plaintiff got out and went to the rear of the vehicle. He looked to his left and saw that there were no cars coming from that direction. He looked to his right and saw the headlights of an approaching vehicle. He stated that he assumed or thought that he could safely cross the street before the vehicle came to where he was about to cross. Once he started to cross he looked straight ahead and did not look to his right again. He said that the street was quite dark. In chief he said that as he was crossing he walked at a normal pace. On cross-examination he said that he was walking a little faster than at a normal pace. Gilpin Avenue is a two lane street with a gravel shoulder on each side of the road. Mr. Dha testified that he was almost across the street, with one foot on the blacktop and one foot on the gravel shoulder, when he felt a push on his right side and heard the squeal of tires. He thought that he had been pushed by the right side front bumper of the car. He said that although he was not thrown by the force of the impact, it did cause him to fall onto the gravel shoulder. When he looked up he saw that the car had come to a stop where he had fallen. The defendant testified that about 6:45 p.m. she was driving her 1985 Volvo in the westbound lane on Gilpin Avenue. The road was a little damp. Her automobile was in good condition and her headlights were on. She stated that she was familiar with the area. Although there are street lights on Gilpin, they are far apart and the road was dark in certain areas. Suddenly, she saw a person appear in the middle of her lane. He was about 10 to 15 feet or a car length in front of her. She slammed on her brakes and the extreme right side of the front fender struck the plaintiff causing him to fall onto the shoulder of the road. Mrs. Yeung said that although she did not see the plaintiff running she assumed that he was because he appeared so suddenly. Her car came to a stop in a straight line a few feet from where he was lying. She said that just before she saw him she was travelling at 30 m.p.h. or less because of the darkness of the road. As she was driving she was looking straight ahead and her attention had not been diverted by anything. She said that she did not sound her horn because it all happened so quickly that all she could do was to slam on her brakes. After she had walked over to see how the plaintiff was, she went to the nearest house and called the police. Clearly the plaintiff was the primary cause of his own misfortune. He was negligent in crossing in the middle of the block having seen the headlights of an approaching vehicle from his right. Since it was dark, he should have realized that it was dangerous to guess as to the distance between himself and the oncoming headlights. Added to that danger was the fact that other than seeing the oncoming headlights, he had no way of gauging the speed of the vehicle with any degree of accuracy. For his own safety he should have waited for the vehicle to pass by before he started to cross. He compounded his negligence in that although he was aware of the presence of an oncoming vehicle, travelling at an unknown speed, he looked straight ahead as he walked and did not look to his right again in order to ascertain the whereabouts of the oncoming vehicle. In so doing he was not only negligent but he also failed to yield the right-of-way to the defendant contrary to provisions of s. 182 of the Motor Vehicle Act . Counsel for the plaintiff submits that since the plaintiff was wearing a camel coloured coat, the defendant should have seen him before he reached the middle of her lane. I do not agree. It is common ground that Gilpin Avenue is a poorly lit street and it was dark where the plaintiff was crossing. Furthermore, it is clear on the evidence that the defendant was travelling on the extreme right side of her lane. That is borne out by the fact that it was the extreme right side of her fender or bumper which pushed the plaintiff, as a result of which he, being almost across the road, fell on the gravel shoulder. Thus, from that position on the straight road her headlights would make the plaintiff visible to her only when he suddenly appeared in the middle of her lane of travel. However, the defendant was contributorily negligent. I accept Mrs. Yeung's evidence that she first saw the plaintiff when he appeared suddenly in the middle of her lane of travel and that upon seeing him she slammed on her brakes. I also accept her evidence that she was travelling at approximately 30 m.p.h. However, I am unable to accept her evidence that the plaintiff was approximately 10-15 feet or one car length in front of her when she saw him and applied her brakes. Given her stated speed and the fact that she came to a stop where the defendant had fallen, it would have been impossible for her to bring her vehicle to a stop in that short a distance. It is a well known fact that in the time that it takes a motorist travelling at 30 m.p.h. to apply his\/her brakes and come to a stop, the vehicle will have travelled 80-90 feet. I, therefore, conclude that the plaintiff must have been between 80-90 feet from the defendant when she saw him and applied her brakes. Given that she was that far from the plaintiff, Mrs. Yeung was negligent in failing to take any evasive action whatsoever to avoid striking the plaintiff. Furthermore, she failed to give a warning by sounding the horn of her vehicle contrary to the provision of s. 183(b) of the Motor Vehicle Act . I apportion liability at 60% against the plaintiff and 40% against the defendant. From the scene of the accident the plaintiff was taken by ambulance to the Burnaby General Hospital. He was examined by a doctor who found no fractures. The doctor dressed the plaintiff's wounds, gave him painkillers and sent him home. The following day Mr. Dha saw his family doctor with complaints of pain of his hip, neck and shoulder and upper back. These injuries cleared up in three or four weeks. In addition to the above he had a swollen right thumb which pained him. As well his left knee was stiff and swollen which caused him pain when stressed. He was told to rest and to take analgesics. His doctor also told him to apply ice. In accordance with the doctor's instructions, he returned on January 2 and January 5, 1990. His right thumb was still swollen and painful and he had difficulty in grasping with his right hand. The thumb injury was classified as a severe sprain or extension beyond the normal range and movement for that joint. His left knee was painful. The doctor advised that he not return to work and to exercise his left knee with quadriceps exercises. The plaintiff followed those instructions. He returned to the doctor on January 9 and 16. Examination showed right thumb tenderness and tenderness over his left knee medial collateral ligaments. He was unable to squat or to kneel and found it impossible to remain standing for prolonged periods. The doctor sent him to a physiotherapist for treatment. The plaintiff next saw the doctor on January 23 and 26. He had pain on the medial aspect of the left knee joint. The doctor found some evidence of fluid in the joint as well as some lateral instability. The right thumb swelling and tenderness were unchanged. The doctor referred him to an orthopaedic surgeon who saw him on February 12. The orthopaedic surgeon felt that the plaintiff might benefit from further physiotherapy and a stabilization brace for his left knee. He was fitted with a brace in late March. On April 3, 1990, the plaintiff returned to his job as an assistant lathe operator with Westcoast Plywood Co. Limited. After four or five hours at work his brace became very tight and when it was removed he found that his knee was swollen. His thumb had also swollen. On April 5, he went to his doctor who advised him to remain off work, to attend the physiotherapist and to again see the orthopaedic surgeon. The plaintiff continued to see his doctor at regular intervals. By May 10 his knee was considerably stronger and more comfortable. With his brace on he was able to jog and ride his bicycle. His doctor encouraged him to do so. On May 28 it was agreed that he would do a work trial and report back in a week. On June 4, 1990 the plaintiff returned to work. Although there was swelling of the left knee and right thumb at the end of a shift, the plaintiff elected to continue working. He was only able to work with his brace on. His right thumb continued to bother him and that discomfort increased with use. The thumb problem resolved some time after October, 1990. The orthopaedic surgeon had evaluated the knee on several occasions. His clinical diagnosis was that the plaintiff had a torn medial meniscus. The knee had not responded well to conservative treatment and was a continuing problem to the plaintiff. Therefore, on November 26, 1990 the surgeon suggested an arthroscopic examination of the knee. The plaintiff agreed and the doctor made the necessary arrangements. However, Mr. Dha changed his mind because a friend, who had an unsuccessful knee surgery, advised that he only have the surgery as a last resort. The plaintiff returned to the orthopaedic surgeon in late 1991 because of his continuing knee problems. On February 20, 1992 he underwent arthroscopic surgery under local anaesthetic. The intra-operative findings showed that he had a flap tear of the anterior horn of the medial meniscus with extension radially into the edge. Therefore, the surgeon performed a partial maniscectomy. Mr. Dha returned to work two and a half weeks after the surgery. Within a few months he had made a complete recovery and has had no further problems with his left knee. I have read the cases relating to awards of non-pecuniary damages cited by both counsel. However, the facts in those cases differ substantially from the particular facts herein. In my view, the appropriate award for non-pecuniary damages is $25,000. In summary the plaintiff's damages are as follows: Non-pecuniary $25,000.00 Wage loss (as agreed) $13,145.86 Total $$38,145.86 Therefore, the plaintiff will have judgment in the sum of $15,258.35, being 40% of the total damages suffered. He will also have pre-judgment interest on 40% of the non-pecuniary damages, at the rate set by the Registrar, from December 28, 1989. The plaintiff and the defendant are each awarded their proportionate costs pursuant to the Negligence Act . Costs are fixed at Scale 3. \"MACKOFF J.\" Vancouver, B.C.

JUSTICE WILKINSON ) (RESPONDENT) ) C.R. PENTY, Esq., for the Plaintiff H.R. BERGE, Esq., for the Defendants THE COURT: (ORAL) This is an appeal from a decision of the Master made October 27th, 1993. The Master was making a ruling under Rule 18 and\/or Rule 31. He was ruling on a motion to dismiss certain portions of the plaintiff's claim in this action and those portions were the claims of the plaintiff to have a declaration of trust concerning a house in the name of Ms. Scouten. The facts are set out in the decision of the Master and the facts disclose that what appears to me to have been a loan was made by the plaintiff to the defendant, Mr. Scouten, in order to assist him in buying a house at the time he was commencing employment with the plaintiff. Very briefly, the funds were requested by Mr. Scouten of the plaintiff on certain terms that I will refer to later. The funds were then advanced by the plaintiff to the solicitors for Mr. Scouten. The same solicitors were apparently acting for Ms. Scouten. It appears that the original view was that the property would be purchased in the name of Mr. Scouten although there is some reference later on to an interim agreement being signed by both Mr. and Ms. Scouten as purchasers. In fact, what took place after the funds were advanced was that the solicitors used the funds to purchase the property and put it entirely in the name of Ms. Scouten. The plaintiff, after a falling out between himself and Mr. Scouten, then brought this action claiming, in essence, some form of trust or interest in the property and a Lis Pendens to secure his claim pending trial. The plaintiff's claim appears to be based in trust although there is a reference to an agreement to give a mortgage, and constructive trust and resulting trust were also brought up before the Master. I am profoundly unhappy with the pleadings, but the defendants have taken the position that I should deal with the substance of the claim in trust and deal with the matter of amendments later. In essence, the Master found that there was not a constructive trust because there was a juristic reason for the advance of funds, namely; the fact that the monies were lent. He also found that as far as a resulting trust was concerned that there was no agreement, or intention that some or all of the property would be returned to the settler. I accept that the law as to the function of the Master hearing this application was as set out by Mr. Berge, for the defendants, and that my function on appeal is as set out in Mr. Berge's brief. Mr. Berge posits that the test for the Master was whether or not there was a real and substantial issue to be tried and that his function was not to determine disputed questions of fact or law, either under Rule 31 or Rule 18, and that my function is to determine whether his decision was clearly wrong or demonstrates an error in principle. I have no difficulty with the finding of the Master that the transaction in question was a loan. What I do have difficulty with is the terms under which that loan was made or expressed otherwise, the inducement or representation made by Mr. Scouten in order to secure the loan and funds. In Exhibit K to Mr. Scouten's affidavit of April 13th there is a note or a portion of a note from him to Mr. Ecker and it says: \"As I see it you should be protected. The house should be in your name with me purchasing it from you on an agreement for sale also I can re-mortgage and pay down after you return.\" (Quoted as Read) In my view, this whole case boils down to the question of whether or not those words form the basis on which these monies were advanced and whether or not that basis was that the plaintiff would be secured by way of title or some other charge upon the property in question. If Mr. Scouten, in fact, was obliged to do that or undertook some trust obligation against the property or an interest in it to protect or secure the plaintiff and took the money on that basis and used the money on that basis and acquired the property on that basis, then it seems to me that there is a triable issue as to whether that gives rise to a trust obligation with reference to the property itself. There are a number of matters that will have to be gone into as to the exact arrangements with the solicitors and what the knowledge of the solicitors and Ms. Scouten was, but it appears to me that in carrying out his judicial functions in this case, the Master ought to have factored into account those statements in Exhibit K which preceded the advancement of the funds. It also appears to me that when one has taken that statement into account there is a triable issue. As I have said before I am profoundly unhappy with the pleadings in this case. It appears to me that perhaps what is really being dealt with is an express trust rather than a resulting or constructive trust. With reference to a constructive trust it seems to me that a successful claim by the plaintiff would at the least have to involve the plaintiff raising an estoppel against the defendant, saying in effect you cannot raise the loan as a juristic reason for the advance of the these funds unless you also acknowledge your obligation to give me some protection or security against the property. But, as I say, my intention is simply to give the plaintiff leave to amend his claim and to finally get these pleadings into a state where both parties can be satisfied that they are fixed. As I say, it seems to me that the excerpt from Exhibit K taken together with all the other material properly before me does raise a triable issue. It appears to me from my perusal of the Master's reasons that he did not take that particular evidence into account, and that in itself would be error on his part. The issue is not simply was the matter a loan, but was it a loan that was made with certain conditions or terms attached, and specifically as set out in Exhibit K. Accordingly, I allow the appeal against the ruling of the Master. In view of the state of the pleadings, including those that the plaintiff says it intends to file. I am not disposed to allow costs on the appeal. There will be an additional order that the plaintiff have a period of time to make appropriate amendments. MR. PENTY: Yes, My Lord, trial is set for March 7th, and also I won't be using those exact amendments I've put in, in light of Your Lordship's remarks regarding express trust and estoppel, I will be rewording those, but I can have them within, I would think, a week or so. THE COURT: Ten days. MR. PENTY: Ten days would be good for me. MR. BERGE: Well, I'd also like leave to bring another application if my friend is going to amend the pleadings and we're going to have further examination for discovery -- THE COURT: I do not think there is any doubt whatsoever you are entitled to have further discovery. MR. BERGE: Well -- but I want also leave to bring a further application for judgment as a result of the pleadings and further discovery. THE COURT: Anything wrong with that? MR. PENTY: No, I would like to preserve the trial date. It's been set, this is the second time already, but I have no objection to further discoveries or -- THE COURT: We11, that's not necessarily going to affect the trial date. M.R. PENTY: No, I am just dealing with the -- THE COURT: What about the time limits now? There may be further discovery on both your parts -- MR. PENTY: Yes, that's -- THE COURT: -- following these amendments it seems to me. MR. PENTY: -- there may be. I know that Mr. Berge has some holidays planned. I myself have a week of holidays planned in February, but the -- we should perhaps deal with the amendments first on both sides in the sense that my pleadings within ten days and Mr. Berge's back within ten days. Is that kind of reasonable? And then kind of march the time from there as to have all discoveries concluded, based on those amendments, by the third week in February. I am just proposing these dates as a -- MR. BERGE: Well, I am going -- THE COURT: Do you want me setting time limits that far ahead -- MR. BERGE: No. THE COURT: -- or should I just set the time limit on the amendments? MR. BERGE: I think -- I would prefer that you simply set the time limits on the amendments, and then I think the Rules say if there is amendments I have so long to do whatever it is, ten days or whatever it is after that so, and then I think everything else will fall in the fullness of time. MR. PENTY: Yes, that's fine,. THE COURT: All right. Thank you both. MR. BERGE: Thank you. MR. PENTY: Thank you, My Lord.

Emerson v. I.C.B.C. et al Date: 20000106 2000 BCSC 12 Docket: 97 4408 Registry: Victoria IN THE SUPREME COURT OF BRITISH COLUMBIA BETWEEN: KIM EMERSON PLAINTIFF AND: INSURANCE CORPORATION OF BRITISH COLUMBIA, JOHN DOE AND JANE DOE DEFENDANTS REASONS FOR JUDGMENT OF THE HONOURABLE MR. JUSTICE LOWRY Counsel for the Plaintiff: D.E. Tourell Counsel for the Defendants and Ernest Crockford: R.A.W. Trann Place and Date of Hearing: Victoria, B.C. December 14 - 17, 1999 [1] In November 1995, Kim Emerson fell and fractured her ankle while she was offering assistance to an elderly couple who had driven off of the road. She did not determine their identity. Her injury did not heal well and it has had a very significant impact on her life. Within two years, she commenced this \"unascertainable driver\" action against the Insurance Corporation of British Columbia (\"ICBC\") alleging the driver was negligent and claiming to be entitled to compensatory damages as a rescuer. Liability and the quantum of the damages claimed are both in dispute. Subsequently, long after an action against him became time-barred, the driver was identified as Ernest Crockford. The governing legislation mandates that he be substituted for ICBC in this action despite the time elapsed. The parties join issue over the effect of that requirement on the case Ms. Emerson must prove. [2] Before her claim against Mr. Crockford can be considered on its merits, it is necessary to determine whether she must establish she could have proven a case against ICBC had his identity remained unknown to her, and, if so, whether that has been established. The Case to be Proven [3] An action against ICBC as a nominal defendant is created under s. 24 of the Insurance (Motor Vehicle) Act , R.S.B.C 1996, c. 231 which provides in material respects as follows: [4] Thus, by virtue of subss. (1) and (5), an action for damages that could be brought against the owner and driver of a vehicle that causes injury can be brought against ICBC if their identity could not be ascertained and the claimant has employed all reasonable efforts to determine who they were. The words \"not ascertainable\" have been interpreted to mean \"could not have been ascertained had the claimant made all reasonable efforts, having regard to the claimant's position, to discover them\". \"Reasonable efforts\" may be said to be those that a reasonable person would take who wished to protect any rights arising out of the accident whatever they might be: Leggett v. Insurance Corp. of British Columbia (1992), 72 B.C.L.R. (2d) 201 (C.A.) at para. 11-15. [5] Ms. Emerson contends that, because Mr. Crockford's identity has been ascertained before judgment, and subs. (6) mandates that he be substituted for ICBC, she does not have to prove that his identity was not ascertainable to her or that she made reasonable efforts to determine it. She says subs. (6) serves to overcome any time-bar and permits her to prosecute an action against him even if she could have ascertained his identity before commencing action against ICBC. This she would say is so even if Mr. Crockford was not insured by ICBC because subs. (6) is not confined to owners and drivers insured by ICBC. [6] In my view, Ms. Emerson's contention is not tenable. Subsection (6) does not provide for the commencement of a second action. It does not alter the time within which an action can be commenced. It provides for the substitution of the identified owner or driver in place of the nominal defendant against which a valid action has been commenced within time. [7] Ms. Emerson could not maintain the action she commenced against ICBC at all unless the identity of Mr. Crockford was not ascertainable and she made the reasonable efforts required. If it was ascertainable, or if she failed to make reasonable efforts to determine his identity, she had no cause of action and no basis on which she could bring the action against the nominal defendant for which Mr. Crockford is to be substituted. Put another way, subs. (6) mandates the substitution of an owner or driver who is ascertained before judgment after the time for commencing an action has passed only where there exists a valid action against the nominal defendant. I consider that in order to succeed against Mr. Crockford, Ms. Emerson must prove that she had a valid cause of action against ICBC. That means proving that Mr. Crockford's identity was not ascertainable and that she made reasonable efforts to identify him. [8] I find support for this view in what was said in obiter in Tse v. Insurance Corp. of British Columbia , [1996] B.C.J. No. 1192 (S.C.). There the court was considering an application to substitute as mandated by subs. (6). While Ms. Emerson's contention was not advanced there, it was recognized that ascertaining the identity of a driver before judgment did not obviate a plaintiff's burden of establishing that his identity was not ascertainable before the action was commenced. At para. 22 the chambers judge said: [9] I would, however, respectfully suggest that somewhat understates the position. It seems to me that it would not be for the nominal defendant but rather for the substituted defendant to make the application for a summary disposition and that if it were successful the action would have to be dismissed. [10] In any event, having concluded that Ms. Emerson must establish a valid cause of action against ICBC under s. 24 to succeed against Mr. Crockford, I turn to consider what she has proven in that regard. Mr. Crockford's Identity [11] As indicated, Ms. Emerson must prove two things. First, she must prove that the identity of Mr. Crockford was not ascertainable, meaning it could not be determined with certainty by someone in her position, making the efforts a reasonable person who wished to protect such rights as she might have, would make. Second, she must prove that she in fact made those efforts. Proof of the second will of course prove the first. [12] When Ms. Emerson was injured, it was dark and raining hard. She had stopped her car, leaving her young son and daughter inside, and gone to see if Mr. Crockford and his wife needed assistance. She fell into some water in a shallow grassy ditch as she made her way around the Crockford's car. She experienced immediate pain in her ankle that was excruciating. Her daughter, who was the first to reach her, became hysterical. [13] Various people helped. One was an off-duty ambulance attendant who assessed Ms. Emerson and attended to her ankle. An ambulance was called. While waiting for it to arrive, Ms. Emerson asked that her neighbour, Denise Beland, be called and shortly thereafter she arrived and took charge of the children. When the ambulance arrived, Ms. Emerson was lifted by stretcher from where she had fallen and placed inside. There she spoke briefly with a policeman before being driven a short distance to a hospital. [14] She did not see the Crockfords after she fell until some time later at the hospital. She had by then been given some medication for her pain. They attended to inquire about her condition and brought her flowers. They spoke with her for a minute or two. Their conversation was cut short when the medical staff took Ms. Emerson to be x-rayed. She determined that the Crockfords lived nearby but did not ask their name. [15] Ms. Emerson did not concern herself with the Crockford's identity at all until more than a year had elapsed. ICBC provided her with accident benefits that assisted with her income, treatment and care. I understand that what Ms. Emerson received was consistent with what she would have received if, through the fault of no one else, she had been injured in operating her car. [16] In March 1996 a dispute arose over her physiotherapy expenses. She consulted a solicitor who spoke with ICBC and the prospect of a claim against the driver of the car was raised. The adjuster involved, Aaron Baxter, mistakenly told the solicitor that he had the driver's identity on file and would provide it to Ms. Emerson if she asked him for it. She never did, and in December he advised another solicitor, who Ms. Emerson had subsequently retained, that he did not have the information he assumed he had. Ms. Emerson was then advised she should make efforts to ascertain who had been driving the car. [17] She says she did three things in particular. She spoke to the policeman who attended but he had no record of the driver's identity, although he did tell her that the car had been towed back on to the road and suggested she contact towing companies that might have attended. She thought she could recognize the car (larger size, white, four door vehicle) so she spent time canvassing the area where the Crockfords had said they lived, but to no avail. And, over a period of a couple of weeks she telephoned towing companies listed in either the 1996 or 1997 Yellow Pages seeking any record of the tow, again to no avail. [18] Her evidence with respect to calling towing companies is, however, flawed. A few months ago she swore (for the purposes of a Rule 18A application) that she made a list from the Yellow Pages of all the towing companies in the Victoria area - 22 of them - and telephoned each of them. The list she has produced contains 22 companies in alphabetical order with telephone numbers. But she now says that: all were not drawn from the Yellow Pages; some of the telephone numbers were given to her in the course of her inquiries; she made the list from notes a short time after the calls were all completed; and it shows only those companies who responded either at the time she called or when they called her back. [19] She says this when shown that some of the companies she has listed do not appear in the 1996 or 1997 Yellow Pages at all. Others that do are not on her list. [20] But what she says does not address the additional fact that at least one of the companies on her list did not even commence business and start using the telephone number she recorded until the fall of 1998. Another, which was operating in 1996 and 1997 did not appear in the Yellow Pages under the name Ms. Emerson recorded until 1998. [21] It is only in the 1999 Yellow Pages that all of the companies listed by Ms. Emerson are to be found. Further, companies that appear in the 1996 or 1997 Yellow Pages that are not on her list do not appear in the 1999 Yellow Pages. While I do not doubt that Ms. Emerson did make inquiries of some towing companies, her list appears to be a fabrication made from the 1999 Yellow Pages. The result is that there is no evidence of what companies she contacted, and no sound basis on which it can be accepted that she contacted all of the towing companies in the Victoria area. [22] Ms. Emerson did speak with one of the ambulance attendants. Christopher Meyer lives in her neighbourhood. She says that she met him largely by chance and inquired whether he would have recorded any information when he attended the scene that could assist her in identifying the driver. She was given to understand that there would have been none. Strangely, however, Mr. Meyer did in fact record the licence number of Mr. Crockford's car on the standard form Ambulance Crew Report which was part of Ms. Emerson's hospital records. Mr. Meyer now has no recollection of speaking to Ms. Emerson but accepts that his recording the licence number of Mr. Crockford's car was largely a \"fluke\". [23] The hospital records, which consist of 38 pages, were reviewed by Ms. Emerson and her solicitor in May 1996 with respect to her injury and its treatment, but they did not notice the licence plate number entered on the Crew Report. Ms. Emerson did not attempt to contact the second ambulance attendant, David Booth. He is somewhat at odds with Mr. Meyer. He says that attendants are supposed to take care to see that licence plate numbers are recorded on the Crew Report. Four months ago, the record of the licence plate number was drawn to the attention of defence counsel in the course of a meeting with Mr. Meyer and Mr. Booth. It permitted Mr. Crockford's identity to be easily ascertained. [24] In my view, it is not necessary to consider whether Ms. Emerson's contact with the Crockfords following the accident or the record of the licence number of Mr. Crockford's car rendered his identity ascertainable. The evidence pertaining to the inquiries Ms. Emerson made of towing companies defeats her ability to prove that Mr. Crockford's identity was not ascertainable. [25] A reasonable person in Ms. Emerson's position would, with the information she had, have followed the policeman's advice and contacted all of the towing companies in the Victoria area as she has said she did. But her assertion in that regard is now so undermined that she cannot be said to have proven she made reasonable efforts to determine Mr. Crockford's identity. It may well be that, had she actually made inquiry of all of the towing companies listed in the 1996 or 1997 Yellow Pages, a record of the tow would have been found. Given that there is now no reliable evidence that she did so, it cannot be said that Mr. Crockford's identity could not have been ascertained. Conclusion [26] I conclude then that the threshold issue as to whether Ms. Emerson must prove, and whether she has proven, that Mr. Crockford's identity was not ascertainable is to be decided against her. This renders consideration of the merits of her case against him unnecessary. Disposition [27] The action will be dismissed. \"Lowry J.\""},"meta":{},"created_at":"2022-03-12T00:56:03.262165Z","updated_at":"2022-03-12T00:56:03.262179Z","project":4},{"id":94,"annotations":[{"id":100,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"start":65,"end":102,"text":"THE SUPREME COURT OF BRITISH COLUMBIA","labels":["COURT_NAME"]},"id":"OHehZQVhq5","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":116,"end":142,"text":"PAULA ANTOINETTE ESSELMONT","labels":["PERS_APPELLANT"]},"id":"usW0fXy8Tu","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":224,"end":246,"text":"GLEN RICHARD ESSELMONT","labels":["PERS_RESPONDENT"]},"id":"UykUZ6pU2f","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":277,"end":289,"text":"DAPHNE SMITH","labels":["PERS_COUNS_APPEL"]},"id":"0-cEIFi1q8","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":325,"end":342,"text":"KENNETH M.

E. POWERS ) AND: ) MASTER OF THE SUPREME COURT ) GLEN RICHARD ESSELMONT ) ) RESPONDENT ) APPEARANCES: DAPHNE SMITH, Q.C. - Counsel for the Petitioner KENNETH M. WALKER - Counsel for the Respondent DATE OF HEARING: December 7, 1994. BACKGROUND: The parties were married in June of 1968 and separated in November 1993 after approximately 25 years of marriage. They have three children who are now on their own, although the children may receive some occasional assistance from their parents. The parties did enter into a separation agreement March 5, 1994. The agreement was entered into without the direct assistance of lawyers. A copy of the agreement is marked as Exhibit \"D\" to Ms. Esselmont's affidavit filed November 8, 1994. The parties met on two or three occasions in the presence of Ms. Esselmont's brother. Mr. Esselmont prepared the first page and I am told that Ms. Esselmont prepared the balance of the agreement. They used an International Self Counsel Press Ltd. form. The agreement purports to be a final settlement between the parties with regard to their rights to property and maintenance or support. (Page 2, paragraph E.) The agreement includes paragraphs 1 to 5 of the International Self Counsel Press form and then skips to paragraphs 11 to 19. There is no indication what paragraphs 6 to 10 inclusive might have covered. The agreement specifically deals with the division of property in paragraphs 11 and 12, and liabilities in paragraphs 11 and 14. Paragraph 16 deals with the matrimonial home. The household items were to be divided evenly and they were to retain their own vehicles and savings and securities were stated to have been previously divided. Life and disability insurance were to \"remain as is until amended\". Mr. Esselmont appears to have been entitled to retain his B.C. Telephone Company pension and his R.R.S.P.s. Ms. Esselmont was entitled to retain her beauty salon, Image Plus Delano's Hairstylists. Mr. Esselmont purchased Ms. Esselmont's interest in the matrimonial home for $52,000.00. Paragraph 17 provides: \" The husband and the wife covenant and agree that this agreement accurately and completely provides for their present and future needs, and each further covenants and agrees that the arrangement herein described constitutes a full, complete, and final settlement of all rights, causes, claims, and demands with respect to support, maintenance, and property.\" The parties signatures on the agreement were witnessed by Ms. Esselmont's brother. Ms. Esselmont does argue that the agreement was intended to deal with the matrimonial home and that they were going to deal with other property matters subsequent to this. She says there was some urgency in getting the agreement signed so that Mr. Esselmont could obtain a mortgage at a low interest rate and pay her out for her interest in the home. Subsequently a disagreement has arisen between the parties as to what matters were or were not settled by the agreement. The divorce petition was issued November 8, 1994 and includes a claim for division of assets and for support. The answer was filed November 19, 1994 and contests the issue of support and division of assets and costs. The answer alleges that the parties are independent and capable of sustaining themselves without the necessity of maintenance for each other. The answer also alleges that with regard to property the parties have divided the family assets in an equal and fair way with the exception of the household contents and pleads the provisions of the separation agreement referred to earlier. Ms. Esselmont filed a notice of motion November 8, 1994 and a claim for a section 44 declaration, no reasonable prospect of reconciliation, has been granted. The issue of interim support was argued and I have reserved my decision. The issue of the maintenance of the medical and dental plans and maintaining Ms. Esselmont as a beneficiary on life insurance and pension plans was not argued and the parties are at liberty to reset that matter for argument if they wish. Mr. Esselmont issued a notice of motion November 19, 1994 asking that Supreme Court action no. 21671 be heard at the same time as the petition in these proceedings. That order was granted on December 7, 1994. The balance of that notice of motion was adjourned generally. The parties were directed to provide lists of assets to each other and arrange for inspection of those assets if necessary. The parties are approximately 49 years of age. Ms. Esselmont is the owner\/operator of a beauty salon and has been so since 1987. The property and financial statement indicates that her income is about $1,461.00 per month gross less an allowance for income tax and C.P.P. benefits, leaving a net of approximately $1,241.00. The financial statements for her business indicate the following: Date Drawings Income after expenses December 31, 1992 $18,000.00 $11,700.00 ($975.00\/mo.) December 31, 1993 $25,000.00 $15,000.00 ($1,250.00\/mo.) September 30, 1994 $13,000.00 ($1,444.44\/mo.) Mr. Esselmont argues that Ms. Esselmont is able to take more monies from the business than she alleges and argues that there is $1,400.00 to $1,600.00 per month in cash that is taken from the business. Ms. Esselmont denies this. Mr. Esselmont refers as Exhibit \"B\" to a statement Ms. Esselmont prepared when seeking financing from her bank. This statement shows the net income pursuant to the financial statements but in addition shows expenses of a personal nature that are included as business expenses. Those amounted to $13,000.00 to $14,000.00 in 1992 and approximately $13,000.00 in 1993. These expenses included an auto lease and operating costs, advertising and promotion such as tickets for sporting events, and an amount for travel and meals and miscellaneous expenses. Ms. Esselmont is presently living with her mother although she has purchased a lot and plans to build a home. Her property and financial statements claims expenses of $2,664.62. The allowance for clothing, entertainment and pocket money, each in the amount of $100.00, could be reduced to a total of $150.00. I would eliminate the allowance for R.R.S.P., $300.00, the restaurant expense by $100.00, the gift expense by $100.00, the liquor expense of $25.00 and the vacation expense of $100.00, reducing the total claim for expenses by $775.00, leaving a balance of $1,889.62. It should be noted that included in those expenses are the lease payments for the automobile and operating expenses for the automobile, some of which are covered by the business. In 1993 approximately $5,900.00 or a little more relating to auto expense were covered by the business. That is approximately $490.00 per month. When this is considered Ms. Esselmont's expenses are reduced to approximately $1,400.00 per month. Ms. Esselmont has been able to meet her expenses on a month to month basis since the separation and it is argued that in March of 1994 when she signed the separation agreement she had been separated for five months and was aware of her income situation. Ms. Esselmont is the registered owner of a lot which she plans to build a home on. The lot is valued at $48,500.00 on her property and financial statement. She also has a $14,000.00 interest in property in Arizona and is registered as a one-third owner of her mother's townhouse for estate purposes. Ms. Esselmont's property and financial statement shows that she also has approximately $39,000.00 in savings, T-bills and R.R.S.P.s. These monies came from the buy out of her interest in the matrimonial home. MR. ESSELMONT: Mr. Esselmont has been an employee of B.C. Tel for approximately 29 years. His property and financial statement indicates that he has income of about $3,872.00 per month ($46,464.00 per annum) from employment and rental income of $1,950.00 per month for a total of $5,822.00. His net monthly income is claimed to be $2,380.00 plus the rental income for a total of $4,330.00. His income tax returns for 1991 show income of $51,000.00 per annum and for 1992 income of $59,000.00 per annum from employment. During argument it was acknowledged that his income would be approximately $59,000.00 per annum ($4,916.66 per month). In addition he would have the rental income of $1,950.00. Mr. Esselmont's expenses are claimed at $5,290.07 plus payroll deductions; union dues - $22.00, charity - $14.00, pension payment - $90.00, for a total of $126.00 every two weeks, or $273.00 per month. This does not include U.I.C., C.P.P. and income tax. I have reviewed the expenses and although taxes are claimed under housing generally, they are included in a mortgage payment. I am not sure whether or not there is a duplication of the total of $170.00 claimed per month for taxes on property. The heating and electricity seem high on a monthly basis but the properties are rented. There is $184.00 claimed for repairs and maintenance but no specifics as to what repairs are needed immediately. The telephone expense at $100.00 is high and should be reduced by $50.00 and I would not consider the $50.00 claim for gardening. There is no explanation for the dental payments which are not covered, at $50.00, or the amount claimed for educational expenses at $50.00. I would eliminate all of those. I note that nothing has been claimed for entertainment or pocket money or barber. Nothing has been claimed for restaurant meals, birthdays, gifts. Debts are listed at a total of $1,136.27. On the material before me I would reduce those items which I have already stated, but regarding the balance there is no indication that those expenses are not being incurred. Therefore the expenses, $5,290.00, should be reduced by $384.00 leaving a balance of $4,806.00, plus payroll deductions. These are considerably higher than Ms. Esselmont's expenses but it should be kept in mind that almost $3,000.00 relates to mortgage payments on two pieces of property and $1,136.00 relates to debt servicing. The balance of the expenses ($670.00) are certainly reasonable. The assets which Mr. Esselmont shows on his property and financial statement include: The matrimonial home...................... $185,000.00 A condo purchased after separation........ $85,000.00 Motor vehicles ........................... 12,000.00 A portion of household contents not yet divided. B.C. pension cash surrender value estimated 25,000.00 R.R.S.P.s ................................ 6,800.00 The two savings accounts are over drafted at approximately $3,600.00. He has a small interest in a company. The assets total approximately $310,000.00. The liabilities including mortgages on the two properties and some loans total $266,250.00. On paper it would appear that Mr. Esselmont has about $50,000.00 in equity after consideration of liabilities and Ms. Esselmont has approximately $100,000.00 plus the interest in the business in assets. There is a great deal of difference in earning capacity at this time. Mr. Esselmont can earn approximately $59,000.00 from his employment and Ms. Esselmont has income from the business at approximately $17,500.00 ($1,461.00 per month x 12) plus approximately $13,000.00 in expenses which are paid from the business but which she has some benefit from. Mr. Esselmont argues that no interim order should be made for support for Ms. Esselmont and relies on the provisions of the separation agreement. He argues that the separation agreement was entered into without any coercion and that Ms. Esselmont was well aware of his financial circumstances and her own at the time the agreement was entered into. Ms. Esselmont argues that there were other issues of property which were to be sorted out later and says that because of the discrepancy in their income support should be ordered. Ms. Esselmont also argues that the separation agreement will be challenged. She will be seeking a division of assets different from that provided by the separation agreement. The factors to be taken into consideration in determining support under the Divorce Act include the following: \"15(5) In making an order under this section, the court shall take into consideration the condition, means, needs and other circumstances of each spouse and of any child of the marriage for whom support is sought, including (a) the length of time the spouses cohabited; (b) the functions performed by the spouse during cohabitation; and (c) any order, agreement or arrangement relating to support of the spouse or child.\" The objectives of an order for support are: \"15(7) An order made under this section that provides for the support of a spouse should (a) recognize any economic advantages of disadvantages to the spouses arising from the marriage or its breakdown; (b) apportion between the spouses any financial consequences arising from the care of any child of the marriage over and above the obligation apportioned between the spouses pursuant to subsection (8); (c) relieve any economic hardship of the spouses arising from the breakdown of the marriage; and (d) in so far as practicable, promote the economic self-sufficiency of each spouse within a reasonable period of time.\" The parties have entered into an agreement which appears to deal with the property issues between them. There is an argument whether or not that is a fair agreement or whether the court should vary the division provided for by that agreement. The agreement states that it completely provides for their present and future needs and is a full and final settlement of all rights including support or maintenance. (Paragraph 17) The parties separated in November of 1993 and the agreement was made in March 1994. There has been no claim for support by Ms. Esselmont until the commencement of these proceedings. In fact, during a period of time when she occupied the matrimonial home after Mr. Esselmont had purchased her interest, Ms. Esselmont paid $400.00 per month towards expenses relating to that home. Ms. Esselmont appears to be meeting her ongoing expenses on a day to day basis, although I acknowledge she may have problems financing the construction of a home in her present situation. Mr. Esselmont appears to have acquired assets and liabilities. The debts which he has taken on would affect his ability to pay support at this time. I am not making any determination about whether the agreement between the parties is valid or whether after trial it will withstand a challenge by Ms. Esselmont. However on an interim basis I am satisfied that I should not ignore the agreement in this case. The court may well decide at the trial that given the differences between their respective earning abilities and in considering the division of assets, that support is payable from Mr. Esselmont to Ms. Esselmont. However on an interim basis I am satisfied that I should not ignore the provisions of the agreement. The court should not ignore the maintenance provisions agreed to by the parties without good reason ( Charles v. Charles (1991) 32 R.F.L. (3d) 316 (B.C.S.C.) Bouck J.). I do recognize however that on an interim application the weight of the separation agreement may not be as great as it would be on a final application. ( Ziniuk v. Ziniuk (1986) 2 R.F.L. (3d) 398 (B.C.C.A.)) In light of the parties actions since the separation and since the separation agreement, including the fact that Ms. Esselmont appears to be able to meet her ongoing expenses and Mr. Esselmont has changed his financial position by taking on additional debt to acquire assets, I am not prepared to ignore the separation agreement on this application for interim support. Therefore the application for interim support is dismissed. There should include liberty to apply in the event there is a change of circumstance.

JUSTICE DONALD ) RESPONDENT ) Date and Place December 19, 1989 of Hearing: Vancouver, B.C. Counsel for the Petitioner: Dennis K. Fitzpatrick Counsel for the Respondent: Andrew Davis The petitioner seeks an order relieving her of a building height restriction imposed by the respondent pursuant to a covenant within a building scheme known as The MacDonald Creek Subdivision in West Vancouver. The petition is filed pursuant to s.31 of the Property Law Act , s.216 of the Land Title Act and Rule 10 of the Rules of Court. The dispute arose when the petitioner submitted house plans to the respondent and the respondent gave building approval conditional on a reduction of the roof height by about three feet. The respondent owns the land on the slope immediately above the petitioner's property. The roof height proposed by the petitioner would partially obstruct the view of some of the condominiums the respondent is developing on the lot above. The condominimum development is not part of the building scheme. The Contract of Purchase and Sale of the petitioner's property provided that the sale was subject to Statutory Building Scheme No. CB58841 and provided further: The purchase acknowledges and agrees as follows: 1. prior to commencement of construction all building plans shall be submitted in triplicate to the Vendor for approval; 2. any dwelling erected on the property is subject to all Municipal By-laws including Development Permit No. 84-18 3. Purchaser will not object to Vendor's development of the 11-unit condominium development on Lot 13 behind Lot 8 and will consent to and sign any document the Vendor may reasonably require to facilitate the development of the complex 4. Vendor, at its sole discretion, may clear and move all trees or such trees as deemed necessary on removal, prior to the completion date. Paragraph 1 of the Schedule of Restrictions attached to the Declaration of Building Scheme reads: 1. No building, fence or other structure shall be erected on the premises and no existing building, fence or other structure shall be added to or extended without the prior written approval of OTTMANN PROPERTIES LTD. (the \"Grantor\"). The design and material for any dwelling must be in conformity with a first-class development of highest stadards and complete plans and specifications (in duplicate) of any proposed building, fence or other structure or of any proposed additions or extensions, together with detailed plans showing the location of the same on the premises, shall be submitted to the Grantor before construction is started and the Grantor shall have power to approve or reject the same. The Grantor reserves the right to require an elevation of the proposed building or structure lower than the maximum permitted by the Municipality's By-laws where in the Grantor's absolute discretion this appears necessary or desirable having regard to topography, the view of adjacent properties, or any other factor. If such plans and specifications shall be approved, one copy thereof shall be retained by the Grantor. The petitioner argues that the restriction is invalid because the respondent imposes it to protect property outside the Building Scheme. In the alternative, the petitioner says that if the respondent has a discretion it acted unreasonably by delaying approval and imposing a height restriction below municipal requirements at the same time as securing municipal approval for heights above those requirements for some of the condominiums on Lot 13. The respondent replies that the discretion is broad enough to protect adjacent properties whether they are in or out of the Building Scheme, and in any event the Contract of Purchase and Sale contains a separate clause for plan approval. On the matter of delay, the respondent says that the petitioner created the problem by failing to supply necessary information as to property ownership when she submitted her plans. Since her property was listed for sale at the time the respondent did not know for whom the plans were submitted. When she clarified the matter the application was processed promptly. Any prejudice or disadvantage suffered by the petitioner could have been avoided if she had made some preliminary enquiries about her house design at an earlier stage. Instead she had the final plans drawn and presented them without prior consultation. I uphold the validity of the restriction. The petitioner (actually, her assignor) granted a wide discretion to the respondent in the matter of building heights. The discretion is controlled by an implied duty of fairness: Behrend v. British Pacific Properties Ltd. (unreported BCSC April 6,1987 Van Reg. No.C852040, Spencer, J). I find nothing unreasonable or unfair about the respondent's determination in this case. The topography of the area is such that each lot can enjoy a lovely view if building heights are controlled. The revision of the petitioner's plans in accordance with the respondent's conditions would not hamper her view but it would remove an obstruction from the dwellings above. This is how the covenant in the Building Scheme is supposed to work. It is not necessary for the respondent to confine itself to the protection of lots within the building scheme. The language of the covenant is expressed in the broadest terms. As well, the Contract of Purchase and Sale obliges the purchaser to obtain the respondent's approval quite apart from the Building Scheme. That term is followed by a paragraph that makes reference to the development of Lot 13 thus forming a context that suggests that the interests of Lot 13 may be considered in the approval process. The doctrine of merger does not apply to this term because paragraph 9 of the Contract of Purchase and Sale states: There are no representations, warranties, guarantees, promises or agreements other than those set out above, all of which will survive the completion of the sale . [emphasis added] The argument that the respondent acted unfairly when it restricted the petitioner while getting over-height approval from the municipality is met by a careful analysis of the manner by which the municipality calculates roof heights. An ordinary peak roof is measured one way (the petitioner's proposed house) and a flat roof (the condominiums in Lot 13), another. The evidence before me is that after making allowances for the differences the respondent stayed within municipal requirements for Lot 13. Even if the Lot 13 structures were above municipal levels, the argument is specious. The repondent's duty is to act fairly in preserving views in the neighbourhood. There is no evidence that the heights designed for Lot 13 will impede anyone's view. I dismiss the petitioner's argument that the subject clauses are void for uncertainty. They are broad, but they are not uncertain. Any arbitrariness or other abuse is controlled by the implied duty of fairness. I accept the respondent's reason for delay in considering the plans. The passage of time was not great in any case; and if time was crucial the petitioner should have pressed the matter more urgently. The cost of redesigning the house could have been avoided if the petitioner had instructed her architect to discuss preliminary plan ideas with the respondent. The petition is dismissed with costs to the respondent. \"The Honourable Mr. Justice Donald\" Vancouver, B.C.

Murphy-Dyson Counsel for the Petitioner R.C. Doell Counsel for the Respondent Heard at Victoria December 16-18, l992 This divorce proceeding was really about a difference in the views of parents about the appropriate future care arrangements for their 18-year old autistic son, Kerry. They agree about most other matters, particularly that the family assets should be divided equally. The older daughter, Candace, who turned 19 in October, hopes to obtain her Grade 12 certificate and then to follow studies with a view to becoming a dental hygienist or assistant. She is living with Mrs. Forbes. Her parents agree that she should have this opportunity and both are ready to provide a home free of charge for her. The marriage has been over for more than a year and on the opening day of the trial I made a divorce order reflecting that fact. At the conclusion of the trial I made orders about which there was no disagreement and others which I considered followed unquestionably from the evidence. Thus, I ordered that Mrs. Forbes have sole custody of Kerry, exclusive possession of the family residence pending these reasons, ownership of the contents of that residence except for Mr. Forbes' tools, and ownership of the 1974 Volvo in her possession. Mr. Forbes was to have ownership of the chattels in his possession and of the tools remaining in the family residence which he removes within 2 weeks at his expense; he was to transfer the 1974 Volvo to Mrs. Forbes forthwith; he was to remove the 1968 Volvo stored in a neighbour's carport forthwith; he was to arrange for the listing and valuation of the chattels in the possession of both himself and his wife at his expense; he was to name his wife as the irrevocable beneficiary of his Seaboard Life Insurance Company number 3063704, to maintain that policy in good standing, and to authorize that company to disclose from time to time to Mrs. Forbes such information as she might request; and he was to continue to pay maintenance on the terms of the interim order pending these reasons. Sufficient monies from those held in trust by the parties' solicitors were to be paid to Mrs. Forbes to permit her to purchase and install a new gas furnace in accord with the estimate produced at the trial. Those orders left for consideration the issue of joint guardianship of and access to Kerry, the terms on which Mrs. Forbes will retain possession of the family residence, the division of Mr. Forbes' pensions, and maintenance for Mrs. Forbes and Kerry. Guardianship of Kerry Forbes The resolution of these issues requires a consideration of Kerry's condition. Kerry will become an adult on February 10, 1994, and begin to receive a disability pension on February 20, 1993, when he turns 18. From my reading of the G.A.I.N. legislation, he is likely to receive about $740.00 per month, although the shelter portion of $325 is variable depending on need. That income will greatly assist his parents, but it will not make Kerry independent of them. He will remain a child of the marriage for the parents' lifetimes unless he earlier withdraws to the complete care of the government in a government-sponsored residence. He will require a guardian of both his person and his estate until he is 19. When he becomes an adult he will require a committee of both his person and his estate. Both his parents accept that reality and are willing to accept those roles. They disagree only on whether he should live with his mother for so long as she is able and willing to care for him, or whether he should live in a government-funded group home for autistic adults after a suitable transition period. While the government provides funding at a cost in excess of $100,000 per year for an autistic adult who lives in a group home, it provides little assistance for such an adult for whom one or both parents is willing to care at home. Mrs. Forbes is receiving the maximum assistance to which she and Mr. Forbes are entitled today. Were Mr. Forbes unable to contribute to the maintenance of Mrs. Forbes, she would probably choose to live on social assistance so as to stay at home to care for Kerry. It is anticipated that Kerry will either begin school in January or attend an adult day programme such as those that are attended by residents of group homes. If and when such a school or programme is found for Kerry, Mrs. Forbes could seek employment during hours when Kerry is away from home, but would need to be available to answer Kerry's needs if for any reason the programme failed them. Kerry has an estimated mental age of 3 - 4 years, and suffers from a seizure disorder and an allergy tension fatigue syndrome. He requires care 24 hours per day from someone skilled at working with autistic youth. He weighs 82 kilos and has a height of 168 centimetres. He has very little verbal speech but can make himself understood by those who care for him, including his parents and his sister. He is generally co-operative, gentle, and slow-moving. Both parents consider him a loving child. He is also subject to tantrums which the parents have learned to limit by careful behaviour modification and to control with the use of a time-out room. Until October 1991 he attended school regularly. When the programme at Reynolds no longer met his needs Mrs. Forbes withdrew him from it, without consulting Mr. Forbes, although he has had joint custody of Kerry since the separation. Since that time Mrs. Forbes has cared for Kerry on a full-time basis with the assistance of a child-care worker for 20 hours per week and of respite care funded by the Department of Health and provided by Candace at an average cost of $200 per month. Over the years Mr. and Mrs. Forbes have been committed to providing care at home for Kerry. He is considerably more functional than most autistic children in Victoria and they did not want him to regress by being among those significantly more handicapped than himself. Mrs. Forbes has been the primary care-giver, the one who worked most continually and extensively with him. Meanwhile Mr. Forbes has worked hard as a journeyman millwright to provide the economic stability and income the family needed. Until recently he has worked the considerable over-time available to him at the Crofton Pulp and Paper Division of Fletcher Challenge Canada where his base monthly income is $4000. The roles the parents adopted during the marriage have fixed their relationship with Kerry. For that reason I granted sole custody to Mrs. Forbes at the conclusion of the trial. There should be no arguments about Kerry's day to day while he is living with Mrs. Forbes. She should have full authority to care for him as she thinks best without the interference of Mr. Forbes. However, because Kerry is totally dependent on his parents for his care, I consider that until he turns 19, Mr. Forbes should share the guardianship duties with Mrs. Forbes. Mr. Forbes has always been the economic provider for Kerry. He will continue to be the major source of funds for his care. It is in Kerry's interest to have the person primarily responsible for him economically have some legal means of influencing the major decisions as to his care arrangements. Mr. Forbes should also be in a position to take over immediately the care of Kerry should Mrs. Forbes become unavailable to care for him. Moreover, Mr. Forbes has expressed an interest in attempting to get further government assistance for the care of Kerry while he continues to live at home. As a joint guardian he will be in a better position to pursue that interest. Meanwhile Mr. Forbes should have generous access to Kerry. He should exercise that access on a regular basis so that Mrs. Forbes can count on regular periods of free time for herself and Kerry can be prepared for the visit. That access should include a regular period of time on alternate Sundays and one evening each week and such other times as Mr. Forbes may request on 24 hours' notice to Mrs. Forbes. If Mr. Forbes is unwilling to accept access as not only a right but a responsibility then I will reconsider my order regarding joint guardianship. Mrs. Forbes has liberty to apply for that change to me until Kerry becomes an adult. The Family Residence It is clear that Mrs. Forbes and Kerry need to continue to reside indefinitely in the family residence. Although fathers of two more severely handicapped autistic adults testified as to the alternative residential arrangements they had been able to make for their adult sons, and counsel speculated on what might become available for Kerry if Mr. and Mrs. Forbes begin now to work toward an alternative residential arrangement, there was no evidence that such a facility can be put in place within any foreseeable period of time. The Ministry of Social Services reacts to need and pressure. Currently, Kerry is being well cared for by his parents with the help of his sister and a child-care worker. If both parents were to desert Kerry he would be placed in a special foster-care home. Mr. Forbes is in full agreement that Kerry and his mother must remain in the family residence for a transition period that could be as much as 10 years, but he considers that some time limit should be placed on the exclusive occupancy order so that Mrs. Forbes will be required to co-operate with the project of finding a suitable permanent home for Kerry among other similarly afflicted adults where he can live after he and Mrs. Forbes have lost the capacity to care for him or die. He wants the transition to be made during their lifetimes. Mrs. Forbes has not accepted that she must face that decision. For the moment she feels young, healthy, and quite capable of caring for him indefinitely. She has grown to accept and like what she considers her job. She gets great satisfaction from doing it well. She wants to be able to continue to care for Kerry indefinitely. While I sympathize with Mr. Forbes' desire to see some light at the end of the tunnel, I consider that I cannot gaze into the future with sufficient certainty to limit the period during which Mrs. Forbes will be entitled to exclusive possession of the family residence. If the parties cannot agree on the terms of that exclusive possession, they may address the issue in written memoranda. I am not prepared to vest the family residence in Mrs. Forbes. It is the family's only significant asset other than Mr. Forbes' two pensions and Registered Retirement Savings Plan. The Pension Plans As at December 31, 1990 the R.R.S.P. had a value of $13513.76. The Pulp and Paper Industry Pension Plan monthly pension benefit accrued as at June 30, 1991 was $548.35. This is the amount Mr. Forbes would receive as a deferred annuity from January 1, 2014, if he had terminated his employment on June 30, 1991. He is not entitled to a joint and last survivor option. Mr. Forbes agrees that Mrs. Forbes will receive a minimum of $274 monthly from that pension if and when he reaches that retirement date, for so long as he lives. The information provided to the court does not indicate that there are any benefits payable to his estate or to a survivor if he dies before that date. Because Mr. Forbes \"broke his service\" under the IWA-Forest Industry Pension Plan on December 31, 1986, this plan will provide a basic monthly retirement pension of $175 commencing at age 65 (2013). Because he has only 7 years of credited service under this plan he is not entitled to pre-retirement joint and survivor coverage. He is entitled to take a reduced pension after his 60th birthday. Mrs. Forbes is entitled to receive one-half of those annuity payments if and when they are received. Probably because of the expense involved in a valuation of these pension benefits, neither party led evidence as to their value. Nevertheless, Mrs. Forbes would like to give up her interest in them, obtain title to the family residence, and pay Mr. Forbes whatever is necessary to equalize the division of family assets out of the proceeds of sale if and when she sells the home. She considers there is no value to her in having a R.R.S.P. or a deferred annuity when it is likely that she will have to accept social assistance if Mr. Forbes becomes unwilling or unable to pay maintenance. In essence, Mrs. Forbes is asking the court to order Mr. Forbes to purchase her interest in these deferred annuities and the R.R.S.P. by giving her an increased interest in the family home. Quite apart from the lack of evidence as to value on which to base such an order, I am of the view that such an arrangement would be unreasonable. There is no question that the court may make such an order under Part 3 of the Family Relations Act against the wishes of the spouse whose only asset is contingent future income in the absence of a contract. Touwslager v Touwslager (1992), 63 B.C.L.R. (2d) 247 (C.A.). Section 52 (1) provides that jurisdiction to interfere with the property rights of the spouses in these words: 52. (1) In proceedings under this Part or on application, the Supreme Court may determine any matter respecting the ownership, right of possession or division of property under this Part, including the vesting of property under section 51, and may make orders which are necessary, reasonable or ancillary to give effect to the determination. In Touwslager the Court of Appeal considered that fairness required the vesting of the family residence in the wife and the pension in the husband. The court emphasized the difficulties the wife would be facing in enforcing the division of deferred benefits. With the enactment of the Pension Benefits Standards Act and the revision of Revenue Canada's policy with regard to the taxation of pension payments divided between spouses on marriage breakdown, these concerns have less force. In the circumstances of this case, I do not think the exchange of a future income stream contingent on survival to the age of 60 or 65 for a one-half interest in the family residence, should be forced on Mr. Forbes under section 52 because I do not think such an order is required to accomplish the equal division of the family's assets which the spouses have agreed is fair. Mrs. Forbes is entitled to one-half of the pension benefits if and when they are paid. She is at liberty to apply for such order as counsel deem advisable upon the coming into effect of the Pension Benefits Standards Act . Until such time as an order can be made requiring the plan administrator to divide the annuity payments equally between the parties or the plan administrator agrees to do so, Mr. Forbes will hold his interest in both plans in trust for Mrs. Forbes as to one-half the benefits accrued to December 18, 1992. Subject to what I have to say about the equalization of the division of the chattels, Mr. Forbes is also to transfer to her one-half of the balance in his R.R.S.P. account at the Toronto-Dominion Bank on the date of transfer pursuant to the provisions of the Income Tax Act permitting a tax-free roll-over between spouses on marriage breakdown. The Chattels The party who is keeping chattels having the greater value will pay to the other one-half of the difference. The payment may be made by way of adjustment in the portion of the R.R.S.P. to be transferred. Maintenance Mrs. Forbes presents a budget of $2020 for herself and Kerry which Mr. Forbes agrees is entirely reasonable. Incidentally, that budget allows Mrs. Forbes to provide a home for Candace at no additional cost. To net that income, Mrs. Forbes requires a gross income of $2250. Her only income is the family allowance of $35. She asks for maintenance of $2200. If Mr. Forbes were to pay that amount he would have $1274 left each month to support himself in his apartment in Victoria after paying income tax and other compulsory deductions, including life and disability insurance and union dues. After paying $125 per month for a car pool to travel to and from Crofton, he would be left with $1149 to spend. Mr. Forbes' expenses, including the cost of operating his car in Victoria, total $1843. This budget is somewhat more generous to Mr. Forbes in matters of personal spending than is the budget of Mrs. Forbes to her. It could be trimmed to about $1500 without too much sacrifice and with some sacrifices to about $1300. Mr. Forbes has potential additional income from over-time. In 1991 his actual monthly income averaged $5000. In 1992 his over-time has been considerably reduced, but has still been sufficient to have permitted him to earn about $44,000 while being off work more than usual for various reasons. When Kerry begins to receive his G.A.I.N. allowance after his 18th birthday, the situation will ease for his parents. He will not require maintenance because that income will produce sufficient funds for Mrs. Forbes to keep him at home. Mrs. Forbes' contribution will be that she will care for Kerry whenever he is not with his father or participating in a day programme and be available for him even then. Mr. Forbes' contribution will be the maintenance of Mrs. Forbes in the family residence, so that she can give the care Kerry needs. Mrs. Forbes will then require $1400 to supplement the income she will receive from Kerry. When the tax consequences are taken into account she will require $1700 monthly. The interim order provides for the payment of $830 bi-weekly. That amount is the equivalent of $1800 per month. I think that maintenance should continue at $800 bi-weekly for Mrs. Forbes. That is the equivalent of $1730 per month. It takes into account the disability pension Kerry will receive. For the remaining bi-weekly periods during which Kerry will not be able to contribute to his maintenance from a disability pension, Mr. Forbes should pay $175 for his maintenance. Those amounts should be paid directly by Fletcher Challenge Canada as they are now. I note from the pay slips that Mr. Forbes' income is being deposited to his account at the Island Savings Credit Union in Duncan. It may be that counsel can make arrangements with Fletcher Challenge Canada on which their clients can agree that will be administratively simpler for the employer than the existing system and avoid the uncertainty as to the dates each month when the monies will be received by Mrs. Forbes. Because I have divided all the family property and the family income equally, I will not make any order as to costs in this matter unless I am advised that counsel wish to make submissions based on a formal offer to settle. They may do so in writing or by a telephone conference call in order to minimize further costs. \"C.M.

LTD. PLAINTIFF (APPELLANT) AND: MONTREAL TRUST COMPANY OF CANADA DEFENDANT (RESPONDENT) Before: The Honourable Mr. Justice Hutcheon The Honourable Mr. Justice Legg The Honourable Mr. Justice Finch M. P.O'Neill Counsel for the Appellant J. F. Grieve Counsel for the Respondent Place and Date of Hearing: Vancouver, British Columbia January 21, 1994 Place and Date of Judgment: Vancouver, British Columbia February 1, 1994 Written Reasons by : The Honourable Mr. Justice Hutcheon Concurred in by : The Honourable Mr. Justice Legg The Honourable Mr. Justice Finch No. CA016690 Vancouver Registry Court of Appeal for British Columbia 233467 B.C. Ltd. v. Montreal Trust Company of Canada REASONS FOR JUDGMENT OF THE HONOURABLE MR. JUSTICE HUTCHEON 1. At the end of the hearing of the appeal we dismissed the appeal with written reasons to follow. These are those reasons. 2. In January 1985 the appellant, 233467 B.C. Ltd., borrowed money from the respondent, Montreal Trust Company of Canada Ltd., and as security for the loan of $614,000 granted a mortgage to Montreal Trust to mature in five years. At the end of the five year period, Montreal Trust, in February 1990, extended the mortgage for a further period of four years. In the extension agreement, the borrower did not have the right to prepay the principal. The issue in this appeal is whether during the term of the extension the borrower could compel Montreal Trust to grant a discharge of the mortgage upon payment of the principal and three months interest. 3. The borrower claimed the right to do this under s.10(1) of the Interest Act but Mr. Justice Collver held that the section did not apply, firstly, because the borrower was a corporation and secondly, because the term of the mortgage had not exceeded five years. Section 10(1) cannot be invoked \"until a time more than five years after the date of the mortgage\" and, by section 10(2), the section does not apply \"to any mortgage upon real estate given by a joint stock company.\" 4. Briefly stated, the facts are that in 1992 the borrower had arranged to sell its condominium project and needed clear title to complete the sale. Montreal Trust advised that it would accept prepayment of principal and grant a discharge of the mortgage on receipt of the principal then owing plus $55,000. By letter dated June 26, 1992, the borrower insisted that under s.10(1) of the Interest Act it was entitled to a discharge upon the payment of the principal plus three months interest, or approximately $18,000. It was prepared to pay a bit more than $18,000 as a matter of goodwill. Montreal Trust did not agree. 5. On 3 July 1992 the borrower caused to be deposited $594,352.58, that is the principal, plus three months interest and miscellaneous charges, in the appropriate account at Montreal Trust. When Montreal Trust refused to deliver a discharge of the mortgage, the borrower, on 28 July 1992, filed a petition in the Supreme Court for a declaration that the mortgage had been paid off and discharged. On the first hearing of the petition on 27 August 1992, the judge ordered that upon payment by the borrower of $42,000 into the trust account of the solicitors for Montreal Trust the mortgage be discharged. He further ordered that written argument be filed to determine the entitlement to the $42,000. The borrower made the payment and the mortgage was discharged. The Interest Act s.10 (1) Whenever any principal money or interest secured by mortgage on real property is not, under the terms of the mortgage, payable until a time more than five years after the date of the mortgage, then, if at any time after the expiration of the five years, any person liable to pay or entitled to redeem the mortgage tenders or pays, to the person entitled to receive the money, the amount due for principal money and interest to the time of payment, as calculated under sections 6 to 9, together with three months further interest in lieu of notice, no further interest shall be chargeable, payable or recoverable at any time thereafter on the principal money or interest due under the mortgage. (2) Nothing in this section applies to any mortgage on real property given by a joint stock company or other corporation, nor to any debenture issued by any such company or corporation, for the payment of which security has been given by way of mortgage on real property, R.S., c.I-18 , s.10. 6. The judge held that the mortgage remained one given by a corporation and thus subject to s.10(2) notwithstanding the involvement of the principals of the company as covenantors. He also held that by reason of the decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in Potash v. Royal Trust , [1986] 6 W.W.R. 550 (S.C.C.), s.10(1) is intended to permit the mortgagor to pay the mortgage off at the end of each five-year renewal period. Thus even though the mortgage was in its eighth year, the renewal period was only in its third year. 7. For the reasons given by the chambers judge I agree that s.10(1) of the Interest Act has no application to the facts of this case. The Position On Appeal 8. Mr. O'Neill, counsel for the appellant on the appeal, sought to persuade us that Montreal Trust had no right to elect to retain the payment of principal and interest and then to demand additional moneys. He also submitted in the alternative that it would be unjust enrichment if Montreal Trust recovered a return on investment greater than the interest revenue contemplated by the mortgage. 9. The first submission overlooks the course of the proceedings initiated and followed by the borrower. The second fails to take account of the legal position of Montreal Trust confirmed by the chambers judge. 10. The legal position was that, because s.10(1) of the Interest Act did not apply, Montreal Trust was entitled to require the borrower to comply with the terms of the mortgage for the balance of the four year extension period. No law was available to compel Montreal Trust to terminate its contract with the borrower at an earlier date. The chambers judge found that the amount demanded by Montreal Trust to do so was simply the price fixed to vary the extension agreement. 11. I think that to be exactly right. Further, the borrower was not compelled by any law to pay that price and it did so for its own benefit to complete the sale of the project. 12. To obtain a discharge of the mortgage the borrower filed a petition in the Supreme Court for a remedy under s.10(1) of the Interest Act . No one has mentioned that s.10(1) does not provide for the remedy of a discharge of the mortgage. It may be that such a remedy is beyond the legislative competence of the Parliament of Canada. Whatever the explanation, s.10(1) has no reference to a discharge of the mortgage or to the state of the title after payment. 13. In filing the petition the borrower was not seeking the return of its money; its objective was the discharge of the mortgage essential to the completion of the sale. When the judge made the order on 27 August 1992, the borrower followed the course proposed by the judge to achieve that end by making the payment of $42,000. It could have decided not to make the payment and called for the repayment of the principal. Having elected to initiate and follow the course of proceedings that it did, the borrower cannot complain that Montreal Trust, although not legally obliged to do so, agreed to participate on the terms set out in the order. These are the reasons that caused us to dismiss the appeal. \"The Honourable Mr. Justice Hutcheon\" I agree: \"The Honourable Mr. Justice Legg\" I agree: \"The Honourable Mr. Justice Finch\""},"meta":{},"created_at":"2022-03-12T00:56:03.261728Z","updated_at":"2022-03-12T00:56:03.261742Z","project":4},{"id":90,"annotations":[{"id":96,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"start":68,"end":105,"text":"THE SUPREME COURT OF BRITISH COLUMBIA","labels":["COURT_NAME"]},"id":"kovd9aSKjs","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":335,"end":373,"text":"THE SUPREME COURT OF BRITISH COLUMBIA ","labels":["COURT_NAME"]},"id":"_nIfpn4IWn","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":579,"end":616,"text":"THE SUPREME COURT OF BRITISH COLUMBIA","labels":["COURT_NAME"]},"id":"FGfXpbdz_n","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":803,"end":840,"text":"THE SUPREME COURT OF BRITISH COLUMBIA","labels":["COURT_NAME"]},"id":"9CKJdF1xQv","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":1060,"end":1073,"text":"L.R.E.

Sissons Counsel for the Plaintiff and Defendant, Welk R.A. Skolrood Counsel for the Defendants, Mantelli and Black Top Cabs Ltd. P. Hansen Counsel for the Plaintiff, Alcombrack Heard at Vancouver: January 4, 5 and 6, 1993 As a result of a motor vehicle accident which occurred on September 3, 1988 at Vancouver, British Columbia, four actions were commenced which were ordered to be heard at the same time as to liability only, subject to the direction of the trial judge. The trial proceeded in accordance with such orders. The accident occurred at about 3:30 a.m. on September 3, 1988 at the intersection of Main Street and Prior Street in the City of Vancouver when a 1968 Mustang motor vehicle owned and driven by Brian David Welk in a northerly direction on Main Street, in which vehicle Tamara Lynn Wahl, Wendy Sue Claggett and Ronald Schultz were riding as passengers, collided with a 1985 Pontiac motor vehicle owned by Black Top Cabs Ltd. being driven by Roberto Mantelli in an easterly direction on Prior Street, in which vehicle Karen Alcombrack was riding as a passenger. The two motor vehicles collided within the intersection. It was a clear, dry night. The intersection proper was well illuminated by artificial lighting. There is no evidence of excessive speed on the part of either driver. The intersection was controlled by multiple traffic control devices for the directions of travel on both streets. It is common ground the traffic control devices were functioning properly. The respective phases of the lights exhibited by the traffic control devices are documented and form part of the evidence at trial. While the plaintiff passengers in both vehicles in their respective actions named both drivers as defendants and alleged negligence on their part, at trial their evidence clearly was given to support the position of the driver of the vehicle in which they were riding as passengers. Welk and the passengers in his vehicle say that as the Welk vehicle approached and entered the intersection, the traffic control device was signalling green. Mantelli and the passenger in his vehicle say as the Mantelli vehicle approached and entered the intersection, the traffic control device was signalling green. In keeping with the proper function of the traffic control devices at the intersection, one of the drivers must have entered the intersection against the direction of the applicable traffic control device - against a red light. Apart from the drivers and passengers in the two vehicles, there were no witnesses to the accident. In addition to the evidence of the drivers and passengers in both vehicles there were filed in evidence at trial a number of photographs, diagrams, reports and the expert opinion of Craig Brown, P.Eng. who assessed the speed of the Welk vehicle at the material times. At the outset, I find that having regard to the circumstances existing here, the sole cause of this accident was the negligence of the driver who entered the intersection against the direction of the red light. In this regard, the relative times, distances, speeds and potential for the taking of evasive action are not such to support a finding of contributory negligence on the part of either driver. See Horseman v. McGarvey [1983] 3 W.W.R. at 564 . I have considered the evidence of the occupants of the two motor vehicles who gave evidence at trial. I am satisfied they collectively were attempting to describe what occurred as best as they could in the circumstances then existing. In this regard, I do not find any witness was attempting to enlarge upon or to exaggerate his or her evidence. When assessing their evidence, however, I find there arises a serious question as to the reliability of the evidence given by certain of the witnesses, particularly that of Karen Alcombrack and, in part, that of Roberto Mantelli. In giving her evidence, Karen Alcombrack was at times barely audible and appeared to be hesitant and uncertain. Most importantly, during the course of cross-examination, she agreed that at the material times she thought \"the sun was bright - it was a nice sunrise - it was beautiful\" and how she wished she had her sunglasses. It is common ground it was dark. The only illumination provided was by street lamps. Sunrise did not occur until 6:32 a.m. I consider it sufficient to say that I find Ms. Alcombrack was disoriented at the time and for that reason, I do not accept her evidence. Mr. Mantelli gave his evidence in a manner which suggested either he was indifferent to the seriousness of the matter or he had difficulty remembering with any sense of accuracy what occurred. For example, he thought the accident occurred on a Monday (as opposed to Saturday); initially that it occurred in the evening (as opposed to 3:30 a.m. in the early morning); and that after the collision occurred, his vehicle came to rest straddling a crosswalk (as opposed to some considerable distance outside the perimeter of the intersection). I mention in passing that with regard to the location of the two vehicles after impact I accept where the investigating police officers positioned the vehicles as indicated in a sketch prepared by them. I have no such concerns with the evidence of Mr. Welk and the passengers in his vehicle as to what is material. They say that as the Welk vehicle approached and entered the intersection the traffic control device at the intersection was exhibiting a green light. The attack upon the credibility of the occupants of the Welk vehicle ranges from the fact of their close relationship as friends to their inability to recall with accuracy and precision what transpired during the late evening of September 2, 1988 when they arrived in Vancouver from Munroe, Washington until shortly before the accident. In my view, they gave a reasonable account of their movements in a City not familiar to them. Some time before the accident occurred, they had jointly decided to return to Washington rather than staying the remainder of the day in the Vancouver area. For this reason as they proceeded in a northerly direction on Main Street, Mr. Welk and the passengers in his vehicle were looking to return to a freeway which would take them out of the City. I find they had a reason to look for and to observe the traffic control device in question and any signage which would assist them in their return to Washington. They were not driving around aimlessly or otherwise but rather with the purpose I have described. In my view, the passengers in the Welk vehicle and Mr. Welk gave their evidence in a straightforward consistent manner as to what is material - what occurred as the Welk vehicle approached and entered the intersection, including the color being exhibited by the traffic control device. For these reasons I prefer the evidence of the occupants of the Welk vehicle. I find the collision was caused solely by the negligence of the defendant Roberto Mantelli, who at the time was acting in the course and scope of his employment with the defendant Black Top Cabs Ltd, in entering the intersection against a red light. In keeping with the findings I have made with regard to credibility, it is not necessary to consider the submissions if counsel related to the principles of law found in Wotta et al v. Halliburton Oil Well Cementing Co. Ltd. et al [1955] 2 D.L.R. 785 and the other authorities referred to in argument. The question of costs was not addressed by counsel. If counsel cannot reach agreement with regard to this question, it can be addressed either by memorandum or attending before me at a mutually convenient time. \"R.B.

AND DAVID LARSEN PLAINTIFFS AND: JCR CONSTRUCTION LTD., THE CORPORATION OF THE DISTRICT OF SAANICH, THE BOARD OF SCHOOL TRUSTEES OF SCHOOL DISTRICT NO. 61 (GREATER VICTORIA) AND AXA PACIFIC INSURANCE COMPANY DEFENDANTS RULING OF THE HONOURABLE MR. JUSTICE R. D. WILSON Counsel for the plaintiff David Larsen D. Ashton Counsel for the defendants JCR Construction Ltd. and Axa Pacific Insurance Company H. J. Rusk Date and Place of Hearing\/Trial: 15 December 1999 Victoria, BC [1] The defendants JCR and Axa apply to dismiss the claim of the plaintiff David Larsen, for want of prosecution. [2] I was not satisfied that in all of the circumstances of this case a dismissal was warranted. Reasons were to follow. These are those reasons. [3] This lawsuit originated in a construction project. The defendant JCR was the general contractor on that project. JCR let a sub-contract to H.T.D. Custom Woodworking Ltd., for the supply and installation of millwork, for the project. [4] Discussions between the general and its sub-trade to that end occurred in late 1994. [5] On 22 November 1994 the general sent to the sub-trade a proposed form of sub-contract agreement. Among other things, that sub-contract agreement anticipated a schedule, starting June 1995, and completing no later than 28 October 1995. That did not happen. The millwork segment of the project commenced in early 1996. Substantial completion of the project was certified on 12 September 1996. [6] On 19 September 1996, H.T.D. filed a claim of builder's lien against the title to the project. This action, to enforce that claim of lien, was initiated 11 December 1996. A notice of trial was taken out on 10 November 1997, fixing 12 April 1999 as the date for commencement of the trial. [7] On 3 December 1997, H.T.D. made an assignment into bankruptcy. [8] On 2 March 1998, JCR made an application for an order dismissing the H.T.D. action, on the ground, among others, that H.T.D. had failed to respond to interrogatories. JCR's application was adjourned generally, on 28 April 1998, on the condition that JCR would receive responses to its interrogatories. And on the further condition that the status of the parties to this litigation be clarified given H.T.D.'s status as a bankrupt. [9] JCR renewed it application for an order dismissing the action on 10 February 1999. On the hearing of that application, the court declined to grant the relief, but did order that the present plaintiff, Mr. Larsen, make application to be joined as a party in the place of the plaintiff H.T.D. [10] The reorganizing of the parties to this litigation was made possible by the giving, by H.T.D., on 14 August 1995, of a general assignment of its book debts to the Bank of Nova Scotia. As it developed, neither the Bank of Nova Scotia nor the trustee in bankruptcy pursued the claims made by H.T.D. in this action. However, the Bank of Nova Scotia did agree to assign its assignment to Mr. Larsen. [11] Upon the necessary documentation being executed by the Bank of Nova Scotia, Mr. Larsen, on application, received an order on 10 March 1999 that he be substituted for H.T.D. as plaintiff in this action. [12] The parties were not ready to proceed to trial, as scheduled, in April 1999. [13] JCR renewed its application for an order dismissing the action on 1 June 1999. JCR agreed to an adjournment of that application on the condition that a trial date would be set, and that Mr. Larsen would file and deliver an amended statement of claim. [14] On 22 June 1999, the matter was called but did not proceed. [15] The trial did commence on 5 July 1999. The plaintiff led his evidence during that week. At the close of the plaintiff's case the defendants JCR and Axa made a \"no evidence\" motion. That motion was dismissed. [16] I then raised concerns I had about the state of the pleadings, the absence of the trustee in bankruptcy, and the status of the defendants' counterclaim in the face of the Builders Lien Act and the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act . [17] On 23 July 1999, I heard an application, which I instigated over Mr. Larsen's objection, to add the trustee as a party to this litigation. After hearing from the trustee, I dismissed the application. There remained the plaintiff's application for an order that he have leave to amend his statement of claim. That application not having been brought on by early September 1999, JCR renewed its application to dismiss this action for want of prosecution on 10 September 1999. I was not able to hear that application until 15 December 1999 by reason of scheduling and availability. [18] The applicable principles for the implementation of the relief prescribed in R. 2(7) are not difficult to state. The first step is to ask and answer three questions. First, has the delay been inordinate? Second, if inordinate, then is it excusable? And third, is there likely to be prejudice from the delay? [19] The trial was initially scheduled to commence in April 1999. The trial did commence in July 1999. It will not finish in 1999. I am told, however, that it may conclude in March 2000. The delay to be considered, therefor, is from July 1999 to March 2000. The delay is troublesome. But, in comparison to the circumstances in a number of authorities which have attracted the remedy, not inordinate. [20] The explanation given by the plaintiff for the delay is twofold. First, counsel's misunderstanding of the scheduling procedures in this registry and second, the availability of court time. [21] If I am wrong in concluding that the delay is not \"inordinate\", then I am satisfied that the delay is excusable. [22] If I am wrong on both of those principles, then it seems to me that the prejudice which must attract concern, is the prejudice to a fair trial. [23] I am not satisfied that the delay will prejudice a fair trial for the defendant. The plaintiff's evidence has been led and cross-examined by counsel for the defendants JCR and Axa. If this matter is to continue, then the continuation will deal with the evidence of the defendant JCR on its counterclaim. [24] Hence, the application to dismiss for want of prosecution was dismissed. Costs of that application will be in the cause. \"R. D. Wilson, J.\" The Honourable Mr. Justice R. D.

JUSTICE SIGURDSON Counsel for the Petitioner: Richard Fyfe and George Copley Counsel for the Respondents: Louise Mandell, Q.C. and R. M. Mogerman Place and Date of Hearing: Kelowna, British Columbia December 20, 1999 Counsel for the Petitioner: Richard Fyfe and George Copley Counsel for the Respondents: Louise Mandell, Q.C. and R. M. Mogerman Place and Date of Hearing: Kelowna, British Columbia December 20, 1999 INTRODUCTION [1] These proceedings concern timber the respondents had been cutting. On November 12, 1999, I granted injunctions preventing further logging pending the resolution of these disputes. Cut timber remains on the ground. [2] Both parties apply under Rules 46 and 43. They agree that an order ought to be made providing for the timber to be removed and sold but each side has a different view of the appropriate order. PARTIES' POSITIONS (a) Crown's position [3] The Ministry of Forests says that it should arrange to have the logs skidded, decked, transported and scaled and will undertake the ripping of any landings, the deactivation of any roads and trails used for skidding and transporting lumber. It will be responsible for fire hazard disposal and other prescribed silviculture treatments. The Ministry of Forests will arrange a competitive sale of the timber and provide an accounting to the court for the costs of skidding, decking, transporting, scaling and the sale of timber, fire abatement and other costs including silviculture treatment. After deducting the amount of stumpage and the Ministry of Forests' costs for the aforementioned activities, the Crown proposes that the balance of monies be paid into court. The Crown submits that the respondents' costs for cutting timber should not be paid. (b) Respondents' proposal [4] The cut timber will be removed from its present locations in accordance with a plan to be agreed to between the parties. The plan will include the following terms: the respondents will buck and skid the trees, build landings, truck the trees to a mill and replant the logged area; enough of the milled wood will be sold to pay the costs of the parties and the remaining wood will be valued and its value paid to the successful party, but in the interim the respondents may use milled wood for constructing housing for band members. The respondents propose that if agreement cannot be reached or mediated with respect to any aspect of the plan, the parties shall have liberty to apply for further directions. APPLICABLE LAW [5] Rule 43(1) provides: [6] These rules were considered in McLeod Lake Indian Band v. British Columbia , [1989] B.C.J. No. 467 (Q.L.) (B.C.S.C.), by Chief Justice McLachlin of this Court (as she then was). The band applied for an order permitting them to remove certain logs to which they claimed title. In that case, the band also logged without permit or licence. Chief Justice McLachlin said the purpose of the logging was to provoke the Crown into challenging, via legal proceedings, the band's rights to the lands in question. There, like here, the timber remained lying in the forest and the parties agreed that it was perishable and must be removed (although they did not agree on the timing). In that case, the band applied to remove and salvage, while the Province sought permission to award the contract to remove the timber to the highest bidder. Chief Justice McLachlin said: [7] Both Rules 43 and 46 are applicable to the case at hand. Here, an order must be made that provides for the removal and sale of the timber and due to the potential deterioration of the logs, that order can not await the outcome of this litigation. [8] In crafting the terms of an order under Rule 43, and it seems to me Rule 46, the Court should fix the terms and conditions which will be most beneficial to the parties as a whole: Jabs Construction Ltd. vs. Callahan, [1991] B.C.J. No. 3396 (Q.L.) (B.C.S.C.). The Crown, however, argued that to permit the respondents to remove the logs would allow them to profit from their own wrong inasmuch as they were not authorized to cut the logs in the first place. Mr. Fyfe further argued that if I made the order, at least in part, sought by the respondents, there would be a flood of similar applications. By this, I took him to mean people benefiting from extensive logging done without a permit. However, I think that is unlikely. If there is such logging in the province, there is no reason why the petitioner could not apply promptly to enjoin it. [9] In McLeod Lake Indian Band , it was also argued that allowing the band to remove the timber would enable it to benefit from its own wrong. That argument does not provide an appropriate basis upon which to dismiss the respondents' application in this case for several reasons. First, there is a serious question to be tried between these parties concerning the respondents' right to log. Second, it has not been suggested that when the respondents cut the timber, it violated existing environmental and silviculture requirements. Third, and most importantly in my view, since the injunctions were issued, the respondents, to my knowledge, have complied with them. Echoing Chief Justice McLachlin in McLeod Lake Indian Band , I am also not convinced that permitting the respondents to remove the logs on appropriate terms would amount to allowing them to profit from their own wrong. DISCUSSION [10] There is a significantly greater volume of logs in the Adams Lake proceeding, i.e. about 80 truckloads of logs. In the Okanagan Indian Band case, there are only about five truckloads of logs to be removed. [11] The order that I think does justice between the parties and preserves the proceeds of the subject matter pending resolution of this dispute is as follows. [12] The respondents should be permitted to buck and skid the trees, build the necessary landings and truck the trees from their present location to a mill and then replant the area in question. It was not suggested that the respondents did not have the expertise to do this. The bands, as they cut the logs, can best locate the logs, a fact that may be of assistance if the removal takes place when there is significant snow. The Province argued that this work should be awarded by public tender with the costs so determined. I direct that the respondents be entitled to charge a reasonable amount for this work, at a cost to be determined and agreed between the parties. The petitioner has access to recent information regarding the cost of removing logs and taking them to mills and I think the reasonableness of the respondents' costs can be measured against these usual costs. I believe that the Province has a good idea what current reasonable costs for this work are. I anticipate that the parties will have little trouble agreeing on those reasonable costs but there shall be liberty to apply to fix them if the parties cannot agree. [13] Much of the debate at the hearing concerned not only who should remove the logs but also when the logs had to be, and ought to be, removed. The logs in the forest are infested with beetles and if the logs remain too long on the forest floor, they will be susceptible to insect damage, cracking and blue stain. There is a debate in the affidavit material as to the appropriate time to remove the logs and replant the area. The Crown says that there is no urgency to remove the logs over the winter period, that it is unwise to remove them in the immediate future but that May or June is the absolute deadline. In light of the fact that planning must be done before removing the logs, something which both parties feel is necessary, I think it is expedient to make an order at this time. [14] The question of replanting and meeting silviculture requirements is also in issue, and, although the respondents intend to meet the petitioner's minimal requirements, they claim to intend to do more than satisfy the existing requirements. [15] I have read the affidavits filed by both sides on the questions of the optimum time to remove the logs, taking into account the risks to the timber and the environment. Both sides are evidently alive to the issues that must be considered when deciding when and how to remove the timber. The affidavit material demonstrates, in my view, that the petitioner has broader expertise in connection with these issues, which is not surprising given its overall responsibility for the management of the forests in this province. Consequently, I think that it is appropriate, given the petitioner's regulatory responsibility and expertise, that the question of the timing and manner of the removal of any logs and any necessary steps required for the silviculture prescription, including replanting, be at the direction of the petitioner after the parties have consulted. In terms of supervision, I was informed by Ms. Mandell that the hauling can easily be supervised by the petitioner but the real issue is reforestation, an area where the bands want to consult with other people, not just timber experts. I direct that the respondents, in removing the logs, comply with the terms of the Forest Practices Code and the silviculture prescription for the areas in question. This should not prevent the respondents from taking steps that are in excess of these requirements. I leave this matter to be agreed upon by the parties. Again, if the parties are unable to agree, they may apply for directions. [16] Once the timber is sold, the issue arises as to what expenses are to be deducted and what is to be done with the net proceeds or the milled lumber in lieu of those proceeds in the interim. I think that it is just that both parties' costs incurred in connection with the logging to date be deducted from the proceeds including stumpage. Again, if the parties cannot agree on the amount of those reasonable costs, they will have liberty to apply to me to settle them. [17] The question then becomes what to do with the net proceeds in the interim. The bands suggest that an order ought to be made that the proceeds or, in fact, the milled timber be used for housing for band members, who according to the affidavit material have a pressing need. I recognize that the bands have a need for money or timber to help address their urgent need for better and additional housing for its members. However, the entitlement to the timber or the proceeds from the sale of the timber is at this stage very much in issue. The respondents may ultimately be successful but they may, as well, be unsuccessful. Further, there is no suggestion that an undertaking as to damages from the respondents would provide adequate security in these particular circumstances. [18] Accordingly, in the absence of an agreement between the parties that the timber or proceeds may be used for housing, I will make, what I think is, the usual interlocutory order when the ownership of property is in question. I order that the net proceeds generated from the sale of the logs be held in trust with the respondents' lawyers pending the outcome of this litigation. [19] If the parties are unable to reach any of the agreements that this order contemplates, they shall have liberty to apply for further directions. \"Sigurdson J\" January 6, 2000 -- Corrigendum to paragraph 8 changing word from \"floodgate\" to \"flood\""},"meta":{},"created_at":"2022-03-12T00:56:03.261299Z","updated_at":"2022-03-12T00:56:03.261313Z","project":4},{"id":83,"annotations":[{"id":89,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"start":30,"end":66,"text":"Court of Appeal for British Columbia","labels":["COURT_NAME"]},"id":"EWhJ6Q32HY","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":209,"end":227,"text":"MR.

JUSTICE TAYLOR DEFENDANT ) (APPELLANT) ) Before: The Honourable The Chief Justice The Honourable Mr. Justice Taylor The Honourable Mr. Justice Wood Michael D. Adlem Counsel for the Appellant Randall W. Callan Counsel for the Respondent Place and Date of Hearing Victoria, British Columbia November 22, 1990 Place and Date of Judgment Vancouver, British Columbia January 2, 1991 FOR THE COURT The principal question raised on this appeal is whether a 1988 amendment to the Law and Equity Act , R.S.B.C. 1979, c. 224, by which the action per quod servitium amisit was abolished should be given retrospective effect, so as to operate as a bar to the continuation of an action already in progress. (a) The Background The claim was brought by the federal Crown, more than a year before the abolition section came into effect, against a driver involved in a motor vehicle accident in which a soldier, Cpl. Richard Hodges, was injured. Cpl. Hodges was treated in part by military medical personnel in military facilities, and in part by civilian personnel and in civilian facilities. The Crown seeks to recover his pay during his period of disability prior to discharge, the cost of his civilian treatment and the \"value\" of the treatment he was given by military medical personnel and in military facilities. The defendant driver denies responsibility for the accident, pleads Section 59 of the Law and Equity Act by which the right of action per quod servitium amisit was abolished, and says that if the Crown has a claim, despite Section 59, it does not include recovery of the value of medical treatment provided by personnel employed by the Crown or the use of government facilities. The defendant says the claim, if there is one, is restricted to recovery of the serviceman's pay and money actually paid by the federal Crown to others for his treatment. The two questions--whether the present action is statute-barred, and, if not, whether it extends to recovery of the disputed medical costs--were set down for determination on agreed facts prior to trial of issues relating to the accident itself. Mr. Justice Callaghan decided both questions in favour of the Crown, and the defendant now appeals. (b) Retrospective Operation Section 59 of the Law and Equity Act , which came into effect by proclamation on October 7, 1988, more than a year after this action was commenced, says: No action is maintainable for damages for loss of servitium and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the action per quod servitium amisit is abolished. It is, of course, a well-established principle that statutory provisions which curtail or extinguish substantive rights are presumed not to have retrospective effect unless that intention is clearly apparent, or arises by necessary implication, from the language adopted by the legislature. At its narrowest, the question raised in the present case is whether the expression \"no action is maintainable\" with which the section opens means 'no action may hereafter be commenced', on the one hand, or 'no action may hereafter be continued or commenced' on the other. To \"maintain\" an action means to carry it on, and in an appropriate context may refer to actions already in progress. But the law must lean against such an interpretation in the present context. The simple statement that \"the action per quod servitium amisit is abolished\", without more, is, in my view, clearly inadequate to overcome the presumption. The purpose of rules of restrictive interpretation of this sort is not to 'cut down' the effect of a legislative enactment. It is to guard against the danger of giving to words of the legislature wider effect than the legislators may in fact have intended. Where rights are to be taken away, the court must be satisfied that the mind of the draftsman, and therefore of the legislators, was indeed directed to the point before giving retrospective effect to such a change--that is to say, the court must be satisfied that the legislators did indeed intend to take away rights already 'vested'. I find myself in agreement with Mr. Justice Callaghan's analysis of the authorities. It seems to me that the use of the words \"no action is maintainable\" should be taken to mean that no action may be brought, rather than that no such action may be continued, including one already commenced. But I think the statutory wording inadequate even to bar an action thereafter commenced where the cause of the action accrued prior to the date on which the section came into effect. In my view the section bars only the bringing of actions in respect of causes of action which would otherwise have arisen after its proclamation. The force of the presumption against retrospectivity has recently been emphasized by the Supreme Court of Canada in Angus v. Sun Life Insurance Co. , [1988] 2 S.C.R. 256. The question there was whether the repeal by the Ontario Family Law Reform Act , S.O. 1975, c. 41, of Section 7 of the Ontario Married Woman's Property Act , R.S.O. 1970, c. 224, which prohibited most inter-spousal tort actions, considered with the provisions of Section 1 of the 1975 Act by which spouses are declared entitled to sue each other in tort, operates so as to prevent a spouse from raising such a defence in an action for negligence brought after the statutory change but in respect of a cause of action which predated it. As in the case of the enactment here in issue, the relevant language of Section 2 of the 1975 Ontario statute speaks wholly in the present tense: I. --(1) For all purposes of the law of Ontario, a married man has a legal personality that is independent, separate and distinct from that of his wife and a married woman has a legal personality that is independent, separate and distinct from that of her husband. . . . (3) Without limiting the generality of subsections (1) and (2), (a) each of the parties to a marriage has the like right of action in tort against the other as if they were not married. Mr. Justice La Forest, giving the judgment of the Supreme Court of Canada, having rejected the contention that the change should be considered procedural and for that reason given retrospective effect, went on to say (at page 266): The rule against retrospective application should certainly have effect in a context such as the present one where a party is deprived of a defence to an action by the operation of the new statute; see Foy v. Foy (1978), 20 O.R. (2d) 747 (C.A.), at pp. 747-48 per Jessup J.A. in obiter . This is the whole point of the presumption. The law is leery of retrospective legislation to begin with; the legislature will not lightly be presumed to have intended a provision to have retrospective effect when the provision substantially affects the vested rights of a party. . . . It is not necessary here to untangle the complex distinctions between substantive and procedural legislative provisions. The provision in this case is clearly substantive. In any case, whether the provision is deemed to be substantive or procedural, it is not one to which a presumption of retrospectivity can be applied. This would amount to a serious deprivation of an acquired right of the husband, and it should not lightly be assumed that this was the intention of the legislature. Later in his judgment Mr. Justice La Forest points out (at p. 269) the special importance of the presumption in a world in which insurance coverage and insurance rates are determined on the basis of the rights of action and defences which are available at the time that the coverage is taken out. From that decision, and other cases cited, I take it to be the law that in order to have effect with respect to causes of action which are already in existence, statutory provisions destroying rights of action or defences must be expressly stated to have that effect--something which can quite simply be said--or be cast in language from which such an intention is necessarily apparent, and that no implication to that effect is normally to be drawn merely from the fact that the statutory language is in the present tense so as to show that the provision takes effect as at the moment of proclamation. An intention that such a provision have immediate effect, without more, will, in the case of wording such as here used, normally be taken to mean only that the provision has effect with respect to rights which thereafter come into existence, or would otherwise have come into existence. I am accordingly of the view that the right of action per quod servitium amisit asserted in this case was not taken away by Section 59 of the Law and Equity Act . (c) Recovery for Medical Treatment The second point raised is concerned with whether the scope of recovery in this action extends beyond a right to recover wages paid by the employer to the employee, and money paid by the employer to others for the employee's treatment, and includes also a right to compensation for the use of the services of the employer's own salaried medical personnel and of the employer's own medical or other facilities. The claim in respect of services rendered to Cpl. Hodges by military medical personnel and in military hospital and other facilities is not put on the basis that extra cost was imposed on the Crown as a result of his treatment--the personnel and facilities would have been employed and maintained by the Crown in any event. No claim is made for loss of profit or loss of opportunity for profitable use. No authority was cited for the proposition that such compensation is recoverable in an action per quod servitium amisit . The learned judge referred to cases in which an allowance has been made for the benefit of a parent who has provided care, and to the statement of Mr. Justice Judson in A.G. Canada v. Nykorak (1962) 37 W.W.R. 660 (S.C.C.) (at p. 644) that \"it is not cheaper to injure a soldier than a civilian because the Crown assumes to look after a soldier during his period of disability\". But it seems to me that the claim in question is not really analogous to that of a parent or other relative who has devoted time to the giving of care, time which would otherwise have been devoted to other activities. Here the personnel and equipment involved were provided for the very purpose of giving care and treatment and would have been so provided whether or not Cpl. Hodges was injured. I am also of the view that considerations related to a desire \"to see that the wrongdoer pays\" are not today normally considered relevant to the resolution of compensatory damage issues arising in actions for negligence. To grant compensation for the use of Crown medical personnel and facilities in this case would, in my view, be to extend the scope of recovery in the action per quod servitium amisit beyond the area hitherto recognized, and to do so at a time when the right of action has fallen into such disfavour as to lead to its legislative abolition: see R. v. Buchinsky , [1983] 1 S.C.R. 481, A.G. Canada v. Szaniszlo (1985), 69 B.C.L.R. 96 (S.C.); Report on the Action Per Quod Servitium Amisit , Law Reform Commission of B.C., November 1986. I find no justification in these circumstances for permitting recovery for medical and other services provided by medical personnel employed by the federal Crown or through the use of facilities operated by the federal Crown. (d) Conclusion I would affirm the decision of the chambers judge that the present action can be continued, and would not allow the appeal on that issue. I would hold that the sum of $129,229 referred to in paragraph 4 on page 10 of the Statement of Facts cannot, however, be recovered in the action, and in that regard only would allow the appeal. I would direct that costs of the application, here and below, be in the cause. \"The Honourable Mr. Justice Taylor\" I AGREE: The Honourable The Chief Justice I AGREE: The Honourable Mr. Justice Wood"},"meta":{},"created_at":"2022-03-12T00:56:03.261011Z","updated_at":"2022-03-12T00:56:03.261025Z","project":4},{"id":82,"annotations":[{"id":88,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"start":70,"end":107,"text":"THE SUPREME COURT OF BRITISH COLUMBIA","labels":["COURT_NAME"]},"id":"Djk3X1wsKu","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":310,"end":316,"text":"R.

JUSTICE MEIKLEM BIDERI ) ) RESPONDENT ) Counsel for the Appellant: R. Tyo Counsel for the Respondent: In Person Place and Date of Trial: Prince George, B.C. January 3, 1995 1 This appeal proceeded as a review of the record of the provincial court, including the transcript of the proceedings wherein the appellant's application for maintenance for the child Joshua was dismissed. 2 The evidence before the learned provincial court judge on the issue of paternity included the applicant's testimony that she and the respondent had sexual intercourse six or seven times in late November and December 1992. She admitted that he used condoms \"almost all the time\" but said \"there were times when there was no condom used, but there would have been condoms earlier that night.\" She testified that she had had no intercourse with any other man than John Bidera between September of 1992 and December 1993. Her last menstrual period prior to pregnancy was in November of 1992. 3 Mr. Bidera's evidence was that he had intercourse with Ms. Carriere three times, and on all occasions wore a condom. The results of DNA Paternity testing using samples taken from the child Joshua, the Caucasian applicant, and the respondent, a black, were set out in a certificate from International Helix Biotechnologies Inc. This certified that the probability of the respondent's paternity was \"99.98% as compared to an untested, random man of the North American Black population\". 4 The learned trial judge commented in her reasons that \"Mr. Bidera on his evidence is originally from Rwanda\". It was correctly pointed out on the appeal that no evidence of Mr. Bidera's point of origin was contained within his sworn testimony, but rather in dialogue between submissions of counsel. I do not attach much significance to this error, standing alone, for the purposes of this appeal. The evidence did include a reference by Mr. Bidera to his mother being in Africa, from which an inference might reasonably be drawn that he was not from the North American Black population, and apparently no objection was made at trial to that submission being considered evidence. 5 The learned trial judge's reasons summarize the relevant testimony without commenting on credibility. No findings of fact were stated other than what might be implied from this comment near the closing of the evidence: THE COURT: Well, Mr. Bidera said that was the reason he used the condom. Whether, in fact, he's right and your client was using drugs, or she's right and there were other people in the apartment using drugs, the real question is, was he wearing a condom? And I'm satisfied on that question that he was. 6 It is unclear whether this finding pertains to one occasion of intercourse (reference to \" the condom\") or all occasions, because the reasons contain the comment \"even if I accept that a condom was used on all occasions, they are not one hundred percent effective in preventing pregnancy\". This latter comment tends to indicate the earlier finding was limited to a particular single occasion. 7 It is also unclear from the reasons for judgment how or why the applicant's uncontradicted, and unchallenged evidence that Mr. Bidera was her only sexual partner from her last menstruation to following the birth of the child, was discounted. 8 The learned trial judge was primarily concerned with the issue that arose from her own astuteness in noticing that the database of the North American Black population was not necessarily applicable to a man from Africa. This issue was not raised by counsel and, as commented upon by the trial judge, no evidence was tendered as to how this might affect the test results. It is not entirely clear whether the trial judge considered the paternity test to be simply of no probative value or whether she considered the probability of paternity, stated to be 99.98% using a database of North American Blacks, to be reduced below 50% by virtue of this misstatement. Reference is made in the reasons to the fact that the trial judge attended a course on DNA testing where: \"the instructors discussed the difficulty of dealing with the sort of issue that has just been raised here\", but no analysis of the issue is made. 9 The trial judge's reasons conclude: The conclusion that I reach is that there certainly is a chance that Mr. Bidera is the father of this child, but the test is a balance of probabilities, and on a balance of probabilities, I am not satisfied that he is the father.\" I can only assume that the paternity test was accorded no weight or only trifling weight. 10 This matter affects the welfare of a child. Even if the paternity test was treated as having trifling weight, the evidence of the mother was uncontradicted as to other possible fathers and she was not confronted in cross-examination on this point. If her evidence on this point was accepted, there could be no doubt as to paternity. If, as seems to be the case, her evidence was not accepted, it is incumbent upon the trial judge in these circumstances to say so, and to state reasons, even if the reason be as brief as to state the witness is not believable. 11 In the matter of the discovered weakness in the paternity test results, it is my view that when an issue such as this arises for the first time at trial, at the instance of the judge, in such an important matter as the long term welfare of a child, an opportunity should have been afforded to the parties to adduce evidence on the issue raised. The indicated probability of paternity of 99.98% was overwhelmingly past \"the balance\" point, and was corroborated by other evidence. In my view the learned trial judge erred in discounting the paternity test evidence on a point raised by herself without affording the parties an opportunity to adduce the clarifying evidence she acknowledged was needed. 12 No new evidence was adduced on appeal, but counsel advise that evidence is available that the change in probability of paternity arising from the DNA testing using the properly applicable data base is insignificant. 13 The appeal is allowed and a new hearing is ordered. \"I.

In addition, First Global Financial Inc. (\"First Global\") seeks judgment pursuant to Rule 18A on its Counterclaim. The plaintiff Casson & Shpak, a Partnership, (\"Casson & Shpak\") has in turn filed a cross-application pursuant to Rule 18 or 18A seeking judgment and dismissal of the Counterclaim of the defendant First Global. I will briefly review the facts: Casson & Shpak are a firm of chartered accountants who provided accounting services to a company known as Nova Marketing Ltd., now called National Nova Marketing Ltd. (\"Nova\"). As of January 25, l992, Nova owed Casson & Shpak $25,220.66 for accounting services. On that date Casson & Shpak agreed to accept 168,000 common shares in Nova in satisfaction of the debt (\"the Casson & Shpak Shares\"). The parties agree that as of that date the shares were of an uncertain worth since Nova was no longer registered on the Vancouver Stock Exchange and was therefore not trading. On January 25, l992, the plaintiff and First Global entered into a written agreement whereby it was agreed that the plaintiff would keep the Casson & Shpak Shares available for sale to First Global for the sum of $12,500 until July 15, l992 or if $1,000 was paid on or before July 15, l992, until October 15, l992. In consideration, First Global agreed to deliver to the plaintiff its 145,000 shares in Nova (\"the First Global Shares\"). If First Global purchased the Casson & Shpak Shares by October 15, l992, the plaintiff would return the First Global Shares. If First Global failed to purchase the Casson & Shpak Shares by October 15, l992, the First Global Shares would be forfeited to the plaintiff. The agreement stipulated that time was of the essence. The agreement was drafted by Anders (a self-described corporate development consultant) although Mr. Shpak himself made some revisions to the final text. On February 3, l992, in order to assist the plaintiff in being able to freely dispose of the First Global Sshares after October 15, First Global provided the plaintiff with a Power of Attorney which authorized Mr. Shpak to freely dispose of the First Global Shares. I find that it was both agreed and understood between the parties that both the Casson & Shpak Shares and the First Global Shares were to be delivered by Nova to the plaintiff upon their issuance. While the agreement provided that the shares were to be held by the plaintiff in accordance with the terms of the agreement, in fact the defendants obtained both the Casson & Shpak Shares and the First Global Shares and failed to deliver them to the plaintiff. The critical date -- October 15, l992 -- passed with no payment made by First Global in connection with the Casson & Shpak Shares. On October 20, 21 and 22, 1992 the plaintiff demanded that the defendants deliver all of the shares -- that is, both the Casson & Shpak Shares and the First Global Shares -- to the plaintiff. Then, on October 22, l992, Anders attended at the plaintiff's offices with the Casson & Shpak Shares and a certified cheque dated October 21, l992 in the sum of $12,500. Anders refused to give Mr. Shpak the First Global Shares. Anders and Mr. Shpak immediately attended the plaintiff's lawyer's offices where the plaintiff's lawyer informed Anders that as a result of his refusal to deliver the First Global Shares, the cheque for $12,500 would be held as a set-off for damages arising from his wrongful detention of the Shares, but would be returned upon delivery of the First Global Shares. Upon the plaintiff's application, the parties appeared before Madam Justice Allan on November 9, l992. The plaintiff sought the appointment of one of its partners as a receiver for the 145,000 First Global Shares with power to sell them and pay the proceeds into Court pending the resolution of the dispute between the parties. Allan J. appointed Mr. Shpak the receiver of the First Global Shares with power to sell the shares. In accordance with that Order, all of those shares have been sold. Issues : The defendants' application raises three basic issues: (1) First, the defendants submit that by receiving the $12,500 cheque on October 22, l992, the plaintiff thereby waived its right to rely upon that provision in the agreement to the effect that time was of the essence or is estopped from relying upon that provision. (2) The defendants submit that the First Global Shares were only intended to be held as security for the payment of the $12,500. By virtue of its recovery of the Casson & Shpak Shares, the defendants say that the plaintiff is no longer entitled to recovery of the First Global Shares. (3) In the alternative, the defendants say that their failure to pay $12,500 on the date originally agreed, was as a result of inadvertence on their part, and that given the great disparity between the value of the shares forfeited and the actual damage caused by the breach, the Court ought to exercise its equitable jurisdiction, and relieve the defendants against forfeiture of the shares. I will address each matter in turn. (a) Waiver of time of the essence provision : It is not disputed that the agreement in question provided that time was of the essence. The case authorities are clear that a waiver of a contractual term requires an unequivocal intention to relinquish a right, which intention must be consciously communicated. ( F.B.D.B. v. Steinbok Development Corp. (1983), 42 A.R. 231 (C.A.) at p. 236.) The onus of establishing waiver of a provision that time is of the essence is upon the party who asserts the waiver. ( Watts v. Strezos , (1955) 4 D.L.R. 2126 (Ont. H.C.) at 129.) On a review of the affidavits filed, I am not satisfied that there is any evidence that the plaintiff ever waived the time of the essence provision relating to the performance of the agreement. To the contrary, I am satisfied that Mr. Shpak made it clear that he required the delivery of all of the shares and that he was not accepting $12,500 as payment for the Casson & Shpak Shares. Indeed, that advice was immediately repeated in the presence of the plaintiff's lawyer. (b) First Global Shares --held as security only ? This leg of the defendants' submission is somewhat convoluted and unclear. It seems to me that the defendants are essentially arguing that notwithstanding the written contractual provisions, the Court ought to accept Anders' evidence concerning the parties' underlying intentions at the time the agreement was executed. The defendants say that Casson & Shpak was particularly intent upon finding some means to guarantee a $12,500 purchase price for the shares. In this context, they say that the First Global Shares were merely posted as security, \"by way of a collateral agreement\", to guarantee the $12,500 purchase price. Since the Casson & Shpak Shares have been received and sold by the plaintiff, the defendants say that the shares posted as security may now be released back to the defendants. In my view, this argument flies in the face of the clear wording of the agreement and effectively requires that the Court admit parol evidence. Parol evidence is only admissible to explain an ambiguity in the language of a written agreement. Since there is none on the face of the agreement before the Court, it cannot be admitted. Accordingly, this branch of the defendants' submission fails. (c) Relief against Forfeiture : The essence of the defendants' complaint is that by virtue of the forfeiture of the shares, the plaintiff has enjoyed a windfall -- the shares which were thought to perhaps even be worthless at the time the agreement was executed now have a value in the order of $120-140,000. The defendants says that since the object of the initial transaction was simply to secure the payment of the sum of $12,500 in respect of the Casson & Shpak Shares, the Court ought to exercise its equitable jurisdiction and relieve against the forfeiture of the shares resulting from the breach of the covenant concerning payment by a certain date. ( Liscumb v. Provenzano Estate (1985, 40 R.P.R. 31, Ont. S.C.)) In my view, in light of the circumstances here, there is some very grave doubt as to whether the defendants have come to the Court with 'clean hands' and are thereby in any position to seek equitable relief. However, I will not determine the issue on that basis. Rather, as a matter of legal principle, I have concluded the defendants are simply unable to suggest that the forfeiture clause is of a penal nature, in the sense that the sum forfeited is out of all proportion to the damage and that it would accordingly be unconscionable for the plaintiff to retain the property in question. In British Columbia Development Corporation v. NAB Holdings Ltd. et al (1986) 6 B.C.L.R. 145 (B.C.C.A.), in proceedings for an order to cancel an agreement for sale, the petitioner sought to include a term that all moneys paid to it on account of the purchase price be forfeited, in accordance with a term in the agreement describing such monies as \"liquidated and ascertained damages\". The Chambers Judge granted the order of cancellation but refused to allow forfeiture of the monies paid, holding that the forfeiture was unconscionable. On appeal, Lambert, J.A. reviewed the case authorities concerning relief against forfeiture and stated at p. 157: \"...So, in summary, relief against forfeiture may be granted under s. 21 of the Law and Equity Act, which, as I have said, merely restates the equitable principles in statutory form. The circumstances under which relief should be granted are where, first, the sum forfeited is out of all proportion to the loss suffered and, second, it is unconscionable to retain the money, in the traditional equitable sense of unconscionability. ... ...So viewed not from the date of the agreement, which is the date for determining whether an ascertained sum is liquidated damages or a penalty, but from the date of the invocation of the clause, which is the date for determining whether relief should be granted against the penalty, it has not been shown that the first condition for relief has been met, namely, that the penal amount is out of all proportion to the loss suffered by B.C.D.C. (My emphasis) In this case, on the date the agreement was executed (January 25, l992), the Casson & Shpak Shares were worth approximately $12,500, less than one-half the debt acknowledged by Nova. The First Global Shares were worth approximately $12,000. The agreement provided that the plaintiff was to hold the shares for ten months. During that time, the shares could, of course, have dropped in value. In consideration for keeping the Casson & Shpak Shares available for sale, the First Global Shares were to be delivered as security for performance. Thus, as of the date of the agreement, I cannot accede to any submission that the forfeiture clause was penal in nature or in any way unconscionable. In my view, there is simply no evidence to support that submission. Conclusion : In the end result, the defendants' applications are dismissed. The evidence, however, supports the plaintiff's cross-application. There will be a declaration that the plaintiff is entitled to claim the proceeds of sale of the First Global Shares. In addition, I am ordering that the defendants' Counterclaim is dismissed. Costs follow the event. \"M.E. Boyd\" M. E. Boyd, J.

Suburban Motors Date: 20000113 2000 BCCA 46 Docket: V03348 Registry: Victoria COURT OF APPEAL FOR BRITISH COLUMBIA ORAL REASONS FOR JUDGMENT Before: The Honourable Mr. Justice Finch January 13, 2000 The Honourable Mr. Justice Donald The Honourable Madam Justice Newbury Victoria, B.C. BETWEEN: CURTIS CHRISTIE PLAINTIFF (APPELLANT) AND: SUBURBAN MOTORS LTD. DEFENDANT (RESPONDENT) Douglas H. Christie appearing for the Appellant Robert T.C. Johnston, Q.C. appearing for the Respondent [1] DONALD, J.A.: The plaintiff, Curtis Christie, appeals from the dismissal of his action for breach of contract. [2] The contract was one of employment. The plaintiff claimed that the defendant failed to train him properly as an autobody repairman during a four year apprenticeship and that when the defendant offered him a non-journeyman position at the end of his term he was constructively dismissed. [3] The trial was heard by Mr. Justice Melvin who, in his reasons given on 16 September 1998, held that the plaintiff did not prove that the defendant had failed to fulfill its obligations under the apprenticeship agreement nor did the plaintiff prove any loss. [4] The judge observed that it was \"tragic\" that the plaintiff refused an offer to extend the apprenticeship period for an additional year at the fourth year rate of pay (90% of the journeyman rate). In so refusing the offer the judge said that the plaintiff \"authored his own misfortune\". [5] On appeal the plaintiff alleges that the trial judge erred in failing to address the specific claims and by ignoring important evidence. [6] For reasons which follow I have not been persuaded that the decision should be disturbed. [7] The plaintiff began work with the defendant on 17 June 1991 washing cars, sweeping up and performing similar tasks. On 22 January 1992 the parties entered into an apprenticeship agreement for a four year term to train the plaintiff in the autobody repair trade. [8] The agreement obliged the defendant to teach the plaintiff the trade efficiently and to provide him with adequate training in all practices of autobody repair insofar as the facilities and scope of the defendant's business would permit. The defendant was also required to notify the Director of Apprenticeship of any difficulties that might interfere with the carrying out of the terms of the agreement. The plaintiff was required to attend classes and to attend at the defendant's place of business and perform his duties faithfully, diligently and honestly. At the end of the agreement, the defendant was under no obligation to certify or hire the plaintiff. [9] During the first year of the contract, apparently as a result of conversations with other apprentices about their experiences, the plaintiff became concerned with the quality of instruction he was receiving. He made no mention of this either to the defendant or to the Director. [10] At the end of the second year the defendant thought that the plaintiff was not performing at expected levels but there is no indication that the Branch was informed of that. A notation on the records kept by the Apprentice Branch for 17 March 1995, which was in the fourth year, reads as follows: The plaintiff's apprenticeship was to expire in 10 months time. [11] On 4 August 1995 the plaintiff learned that the defendant had concerns about his abilities and questioned whether he would obtain certification. The plaintiff immediately went to the Apprenticeship Board and notified them that the defendant was not going to certify him but had offered him a job at $12 per hour instead of the more than $20 an hour a journeyman would earn. [12] The Board then became involved in discussions with both parties. As a result of those discussions it was decided that a concerted effort would be made to provide him with sufficient work to attain his accreditation. A further set of notations in the Apprenticeship office records for October 12 and 19, 1995, indicate that the parties were satisfied with the tasks that the plaintiff was given. [13] However, by November the plaintiff became convinced that he was not at a sufficient level to obtain certification and he told the employer he wanted to leave and continue his apprenticeship at some other place. [14] On the evidence there was a difference in opinion between the parties as to the level the plaintiff had reached at this point. The plaintiff felt that he was still at the first year level. The defendant's view was that he was at the third year level but that it had not yet determined whether they would be able to certify him in December. The defendant offered to extend the apprenticeship term for an additional year on the terms that I have indicated but the plaintiff persisted in his belief that he would not get satisfactory training with the defendant. The parties then worked out his entitlement to back pay and severance under the Employment Standards Act and the plaintiff was duly paid off. [15] The judge held that this constituted a settlement of the dispute. I am unable to accept that view of the matter. The pay-out was simply a consequence of the separation and not a negotiated resolution of the claim that the defendant failed to fulfill its obligations under the apprenticeship agreement. Nevertheless the judgment can be supported on other grounds. [16] The judge's reasons were ex tempore and as such did not touch on every point of evidence nor did they analyze the case by reference to the legal concepts involved. This is not a criticism, it is often better for the parties to get a speedy determination of the case; but it is not expected that oral reasons will be as thorough or as finely crafted as a reserved judgment. It is with this in mind that I reject the argument that the judge ignored or misapprehended evidence because he did not mention certain aspects of the evidence or make specific findings on all points of argument. [17] As I have said, the judge made two crucial findings: Implicit in the first finding is the acceptance of the defendant's evidence that the plaintiff had reached an appropriate level of proficiency and that it had provided him the work experience that was necessary to advance his training. [18] At paragraph 30 of his reasons the judge said: [19] Mr. Robertson was a witness called by the plaintiff as a representative of the Apprenticeship Branch. [20] I interpret the judge's reasons at paragraph [30] above to mean that there was a shared responsibility to inform the Branch of any difficulty in the apprenticeship and that neither party was blameless in that regard. However, he was not satisfied that that amounted to a breach of contract on the part of the defendant. [21] Mr. Robertson gave an opinion that the defendant did not offer the plaintiff sufficient work in the trade to qualify him as a journeyman. But the judge was not bound to accept that opinion. There was evidence supporting the acceptance of the defendant's position on the quality and quantity of the training given to the plaintiff. [22] As Mr. Johnson, counsel for the defendant, argued before us, that conclusion is consistent with the plaintiff's successful completion of his trade school training at Camosun College in each of the previous three years. [23] It would appear that the judge concluded that the plaintiff misapprehended the level of his proficiency and consequently declined the opportunity of completing his apprenticeship with the defendant either at the end of 1995 or at the conclusion of the extended term. [24] One additional aspect of the evidence requires particular mention. Through Mr. Robertson the plaintiff led evidence that on two prior occasions apprentices at the defendant's shop failed to obtain certification at the end of their regular time. Mr. Robertson said that as a result of this experience and the plaintiff's difficulty the Branch declined to authorize any more apprenticeships at the defendant's business. It is said on appeal that the judge ignored this evidence and that had he considered it he could not have found for the defendant on the issue of breach. [25] The judge did not specifically advert to this evidence but, as I have said, because a judge did not mention evidence is not necessarily an indication that the judge ignored it. Moreover, as I will explain, the evidence was not admissible anyway. [26] The witness's testimony on this subject was similar fact evidence. Such evidence can be admissible in a civil case: MacDonald et al v. Canada Kelp Company Ltd. et al , [1973] 5 W.W.R. 689 (B.C.C.A.), but subject to the requirements outlined by Mr. Justice Bull at 699 of Canada Kelp as follows: [27] For a recent example of the application of the similar fact rule in a civil case see Statton v. Johnson (1999), 64 B.C.L.R. (3d) 52 (C.A.). [28] In my opinion the evidence was not presented in an acceptable form. Mr. Robertson gave hearsay evidence about two prior apprenticeships. In order for them to have had any bearing on the present case the plaintiff needed to present direct evidence about their circumstances so the judge could see whether the facts were similar. The judge would then weigh several factors before admitting the evidence as similar facts, not the least of which is whether the case may become bogged down on collateral issues as to what really happened with the other apprentices. In fact, the defendant disputed the allegation that the other apprentices were denied proper training and offered a explanation for the problems that they encountered: in one case the person was fired for insubordination and in the other, the person was only a temporary apprentice whose work was unsatisfactory. [29] The evidence then suffered from two defects: it was hearsay and it was incomplete. There was no admissible similar fact evidence for the judge to consider. [30] Mr. Christie for the plaintiff argued that this was a case of constructive dismissal. I respectfully disagree. The plaintiff was on contract for a definite term with no residual right of employment. The separation occurred within a month or so of the end of the agreement when the plaintiff had decided that he did not wish to continue with the apprenticeship. I am unable to construe the offer to extend the apprenticeship as an alteration of a fundamental term of the agreement because the agreement was about to come to an end in any event. The question whether the defendant would certify the plaintiff relates to the allegation of breach of the apprenticeship contract, not constructive dismissal. [31] In summary, the judge was required to resolve a conflict in the evidence over the adequacy of the plaintiff's training. It is apparent from the reasons for judgment that the judge preferred the employer's version of the circumstances. This was a decision supported by evidence and cannot be reversed on appeal. [32] I would dismiss the appeal.

Stilling, Q.C. Appearing on behalf of the petitioner S.R. Hogan, Esq. Appearing on behalf of the respondent Place and date of hearing: New Westminster, British Columbia November 3, 1993 NATURE OF THE APPLICATION The petitioner seeks an order pursuant to s.15 of the Divorce Act, 1985 that \"the child support payable by the petitioner to the respondent pursuant to a Separation Agreement dated March 29, 1982 be cancelled, terminated, rescinded or varied and that maintenance arrears thereunder be fixed in the sum of $3,866.64 to be paid to the respondent at the time of the settlement of the family home between the petitioner and the respondent\". FACTS The parties married on January 25, 1971 and separated September 21, 1981. The parties had three children: Kimberley Florence, born April 26, 1971, Marcia Christina Lenora, born December 26, 1975, and Jennifer Patricia, born September 13, 1978. The children remained in the care of the respondent following the separation of the parties. On March 29, 1982 the parties entered into a Separation Agreement. The portions of that agreement which are relevant to this application are set out below: 6. The Husband shall have sole custody, care and control of the infant children, KIMBERLEY FLORENCE DeCENZO, MARCIA CHRISTINA LENORA DeCENZO, and JENNIFER PATRICIA DeCENZO, and the Wife shall be entitled to reasonable and generous access. 7. Upon obtaining regular full-time employment, the Wife will pay to the Husband the sum of Sixty-Six Dollars and Sixty-Seven ($66.67) Cents per month for the support and maintenance of each of the infant children, being altogether the sum of Two Hundred ($200.00) Dollars per month, such payment to continue with respect to each child so long as such child resides with the Husband until such child attains the age of Nineteen (19) years, becomes self-supporting or dies, whichever event shall first occur. . . 9. During the continuance of this Agreement and while not in default hereunder, the Husband shall be entitled to the sole right of possession of the former matrimonial home located at 2448 - 240th Street Langley, British Columbia; ALWAYS PROVIDED THAT in lieu of rent, the Husband shall satisfy from time to time all obligations arising out of the Mortgage until the same is fully paid and satisfied. 10. The Husband shall satisfy all property taxes, utilities charges, regular maintenance and repairs required to keep and maintain the said property without any expense to the Wife, and the Husband agrees to indemnify and save harmless the Wife from any liabilities howsoever arising therefrom. 11. When the youngest then-surviving child of the marriage ceased to be a full-time student, graduates from high school, or moves from the said property, whichever event shall first occur, the Husband and Wife agree that the said property shall be forthwith sold, with the net proceeds of sale after payment of any amounts owing pursuant to the Mortgage being split equally between the Husband and the Wife. The Separation Agreement was not registered with this court in accordance with s.74 of the Family Relations Act . The only maintenance paid by the petitioner was $200 in each of April and May of 1982, $150 in August 1982 and $100 in October 1982. She deposes that she made those payments notwithstanding that she was not employed full-time. She deposes that she ceased making any maintenance payments because the respondent was poisoning the children against her and made it clear that he wished her to have nothing to do with the children. The petitioner deposes that she worked part-time only until July 1989. In her affidavit she set out her earnings during the period 1982 to July 1989 based upon a review of her pay slips. The petitioner admits that she was employed full-time from July 1989 until July 1991 when she quit her job. She deposes that her supervisor was an alcoholic who drank at work and that the employment conditions were intolerable. There is no dispute that the petitioner did not pay maintenance during the time she was employed full-time and admits that there are arrears for that period totalling $3,866.64. The petitioner deposes that she worked for Shelter Industries from July to October 1991 then received unemployment insurance benefits until July 1982 when she found employment at a golf course where she worked until October 1992. The petitioner became pregnant in August 1992 and gave birth to her child on May 26, 1993. It appears that she has not worked since October 1992. The petitioner wishes to stay at home to care for her child. She is supported by her common law spouse, the father of the child. The petitioner commenced these proceedings on April 5, 1993. In her petition she refers to and relies upon the Separation Agreement. In his Counter-Petition the respondent seeks, amongst other relief, interim and permanent child support pursuant to s. 15 of the Divorce Act, 1985 or s.56 of the Family Relations Act . He also seeks a determination of arrears under the Separation Agreement and a set-off of those arrears against the petitioner's interest in the former matrimonial home. He seeks a judicial reapportionment of assets or, alternatively, variation of the Separation Agreement pursuant to s.54 of the Family Relations Act . The respondent has agreed to suspend maintenance payable by the agreement for a period of six months following the birth of the child, that is until December 1, 1993. ISSUES 1. Does s.15 of the Divorce Act, 1985 enable the petitioner to seek this order? 2. What is the effect of the Separation Agreement? 3. Is the court entitled to deal with arrears of maintenance which have accrued under the agreement on an application under s. 15? 4. If so, what is the amount of the arrears? 5. Is the petitioner entitled to suspension of enforcement of arrears pending a sale of the former matrimonial home? 6. Is the petitioner entitled to have the maintenance obligation set out in the agreement cancelled or varied? 7. Is the petitioner entitled to a suspension of enforcement with respect to her maintenance obligations pending sale of the former matrimonial home? ANALYSIS 1. Does s.15 of the Divorce Act, 1985 enable the petitioner to seek this order? Section 15(2) of the Divorce Act, 1985 provides that the court may, on application of either or both spouses, make an order requiring one spouse to pay or secure and pay periodic or lumps sum support for the other spouse or for the children of the marriage. Subsection (3) permits the making of an interim order. In this case the petitioner does not apply for an order requiring her to pay. On the contrary, she seeks, in effect, an order absolving her of any requirement to pay interim support. The order sought is in the nature of a declaration of her obligation. I am of the opinion that the petitioner can seek an order under s.15 which determines her obligation to pay interim support pursuant to the Divorce Act, 1985 . However, for the reasons given in the following sections, I am of the opinion that the petitioner cannot obtain a variation of the Separation Agreement, as such, pursuant to s.15. 2. What is the effect of the Separation Agreement? 3. Is the court entitled to deal with arrears of maintenance which have accrued under the agreement on an application under s. 15? It is convenient to deal with these two issues together. The maintenance provision in the Separation Agreement is, in my view, a matter of contract between the two parties. It is not subject to a variation application under s.17 of the Divorce Act, 1985 . The agreement was not filed with the court pursuant to the provisions of s.74 of the Family Relations Act and is not enforceable under that section as though it were an order of the court made under that act. Therefore, it would not be subject to variation under s.62 of the Family Relations Act , even if that section was relied upon. The property provisions of the agreement may be subject to judicial alteration under s.51 or s.54 of the Family Relations Act but those sections do not appear to give the jurisdiction to vary maintenance provisions. In any event any application under those sections should be determined at trial. I conclude, therefore, that there is no basis upon which the court can retroactively \"cancel, rescind or vary\" the maintenance provisions of the agreement on this interim application. Likewise there was no authority provided which would permit the court to suspend whatever rights the respondent may have to enforce the maintenance provision or to take proceedings based upon the petitioner's alleged default under the agreement pending sale of the former matrimonial home. While there is no ability retroactively to vary maintenance, the court is not precluded from making an order under s. 15 of the Divorce Act, 1985 determining the amount of interim child support, if any, which ought to be paid notwithstanding the existence of an agreement respecting maintenance. The existence of an agreement is not a bar to the Court's jurisdiction to make whatever order for child support may be appropriate. The existence of an agreement is certainly a factor for the court to consider in determining interim support and may afford strong evidence that the agreement made adequate provision for the needs of the children but it is not determinative of the issue. [See e.g. Dickson v. Dickson (1987) 11 R.F.L. 337 (B.C.C.A.) ]. 4. If so, what is the amount of the arrears? 5. Is the petitioner entitled to suspension of enforcement of arrears pending a sale of the former matrimonial home? For the reasons stated above it is not appropriate to deal with these issues on this application. 6. Is the petitioner entitled to have the maintenance obligation set out in the agreement cancelled or varied? More accurately stated, the issue is what is the appropriate amount, if any, which the petitioner should pay by way of interim child support, taking into account the factors and objectives set out in s.15, including the existence of the Separation Agreement. The agreement was entered into with full disclosure and after receiving legal advice. The situation in which the petitioner now finds herself was not one which could be said to be unexpected or unanticipated. In my view the agreement is a very important consideration in this case. Counsel for the petitioner submits, in essence that the petitioner lacks the means to provide monetary support and that the petitioner's obligation to support her children is met to a sufficient degree by her agreement to delay a sale of the former matrimonial home and to permit the respondent and children to reside in the home without any obligation on the part of the respondent to pay occupation rent. That forbearance on the part of the petitioner is a benefit to the respondent and children. However, it is not without consideration on the part of the respondent. He has agreed to pay the mortgage and to maintain the property for the benefit of the petitioner as well as for himself. Subject to any judicial reapportionment under ss.51 or 54 the petitioner stands to receive a one half interest in property which has appreciated substantially in value. Furthermore, the quantum of child support set out in the agreement is extremely modest, in part, I conclude, because of the petitioner's agreement to a delay on sale. The petitioner wishes to remain at home with her infant rather than place the child in daycare so that she can work. That is an understandable desire. But the petitioner has obligations towards her other children which ought not to be sacrificed for the benefit of the new child. The petitioner has taken on her new responsibilities knowing of her existing obligations. A similar issue arose in the recent case of Zerr v. Zerr (1993) 48 R.F.L. (3d) 31 (B.C.S.C.) . There the father was obliged by order to pay maintenance for his two children in the amount of $175 per child. The mother, who had custody, was employed. Subsequently the mother entered into a new relationship and had a child. She wished to remain at home with the young child and sought an increase in child support. Clancy, J. referred to Savoie v. Lamarche (1990) 71 D.L.R. (4th) 481 (Que.C.A.) in which the circumstances were similar to those in the present case. The non-custodial mother had a child from a new relationship and sought to have her support obligations eliminated. At p.488 Chevalier J. said: \"In my view it is also unacceptable to suppose, as the appellant has done in this case, that in principle the birth of a child automatically gives a parent the right to be exempted from the obligation of financial support, by unilaterally deciding to cut herself off from any source of income by which she could provide for them. Whatever the intrinsic merits of the reasons for her actions, the appellant must realize that she still has obligations to her other two children and that she can only fulfil those obligations by returning to the workforce.\" Clancy, J. expressed his agreement that a person is not entiled to give up employment entirely and expect a former spouse to bear the full burden of that decision. He did conclude, however that for a period of time following the birth of a child a working mother has a diminished ability to contribute to maintenance but that after a reasonable period of time she should be expected to return to the workplace. That, it seems to me, is just what the respondent has suggested in this case by agreeing to suspend maintenance for a period of six months. It is suggested that the agreement obliges the petitioner to pay child maintenance only during those periods when she has regular full-time employment. In my opinion that is a strained interpretation. It seems to me that the intent of the parties was to give the petitioner an opportunity to establish herself in the workforce and that once she was so established the obligation would arise and would thereafter remain. Even if the agreement were read as suspending maintenance during periods of involuntary unemployment, and I have considerable doubt that that is a correct interpretation, the evidence fails to establish that the petitioner is not able to be employed. I therefore decline to make the order sought under s.15. There was no cross application by the respondent for interim support under either the Divorce Act, 1985 or the Family Relations Act . Accordingly, the Separation Agreement will continue to determine the parties continuing rights and obligations in respect of child maintenance. 7. Is the petitioner entitled to a suspension of enforcement proceedings pending sale of the home with the accrued maintenance to be paid from the sale proceeds? It is my view that the court has no ability on this application to deal with suspension of enforcement with respect to obligations under the Separation Agreement. ORDER The application is dismissed. \"B. M. Joyce\" Master B.M.
