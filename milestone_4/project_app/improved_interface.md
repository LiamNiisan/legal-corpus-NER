# Improved Interface (Optional)

Here are a few things we did to improve our interface and the functionality of our application :

1) Improvising our Search functionality : We have prepared a reverse index where every entity is liked to the document id's in which they occure. This would enable a faster search experience when we have a really big corpus and a lot of entities.

2) Improvising our front-end of the interface : 

- We have made use of bootstrap to increase the look and feel of the Application.

- We have also added a few additional components like Table, Drop down and Logo next to Title.

- We have also enabled Searching for a query by clicking 'Enter' on your keyboard rather than clicking on the Submit button.

3) Enabling Multi Search functionality on front end :

- We have enabled the users to enter search queries for multiple entities in one go.

- To implement the above, we have used 'add' and 'remove' button on our interface which allows the user to add and entity search or remove one.
