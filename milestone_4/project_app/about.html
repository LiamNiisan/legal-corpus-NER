            <h3>Project Overview</h3>
        </center>
        <p>Legal firms' lawyers and paralegals manually go through hundreds of court judgments to fetch a few details of past cases. 
            Many data scientists working in legal firms also require vast amounts of annotated data to predict court judgments based 
            on past court cases. Our annotated corpus of court judgment documents contributes to justice research in BC and Canada.
            In the present work, we consider the Court of Appeal and Supreme Court Judgments. 
            
            The collection of data is limited to only those judgments related to tenancy/rental matters which are submitted between
            Jan 1, 2019 and Feb 16, 2022.
            
            We used a tool called Label-studio for tagging named entities in our corpus. Input takes a cleaned court judgment document
            stored as a .html file. We tagged various entities relevant to the domain: Court Name, Appellant Name, Respondent Name, 
            Date of hearing, etc.
            
            Our corpus consists of 102 annotated documents stored as a single .json file with details of all tagged named entities.
