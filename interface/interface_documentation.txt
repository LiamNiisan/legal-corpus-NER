This file provides technical documentation of the project's frontend.

1. backend.py

The backend.py implements the interface's functionality, using FastAPI that responds to HTTP "GET" requests from a browser. The code is broken down into functions with proper documentation.
 
2. frontend.html 
The frontend.html contains three forms: form, about-form, and usage-form. 
<form action="/about/" id="about-form">  with  onclick="update_about_form()"  and  <form action="/usage/" id="usage-form">  with onclick="update_usage_form()"  invoke appropriate javascript functions. 
When the submit button was pressed, class="submit-button" first checks if the keyword was typed, and if it was typed  - uses update_page(), else - asks to "Enter a keyword to search!".

3. frontend.js
The frontend.js is a javascript file that communicates between the frontend.html and the backend.py. It contains the following functions:
- insert_result - inserts results to the <maintext> section of frontend.html 
- insert_result_container - inserts results to the <container> section of frontend.html 
- update_page  - updates the Main page of the frontend interface
- update_about_form - updates the About page of the frontend interface
- update_usage_form - updates the Usage page of the frontend interface
