        <p class="text-justify">Legal firms' lawyers and paralegals manually go through hundreds of court judgments to fetch a few details of past cases. 
            Many data scientists working in legal firms also require vast amounts of annotated data to predict court judgments based 
            on past court cases. Our annotated corpus of court judgment documents contributes to justice research in BC and Canada.</p>  
        <p class="text-justify">In the present work, we considered the Court of Appeal and Supreme Court Judgments. The collection of data is limited to 
            only those judgments related to tenancy/rental matters which are submitted between Jan 1, 2019 and Feb 16, 2022. Our corpus
            consists of 102 annotated documents stored as a single .json file with details
            about all tagged named entities.</p> 
        <p class="text-justify">We used a tool called "Label-studio" for tagging named entities in our corpus. Label-studio takes as an input a cleaned
            court judgment document stored as a .html file. We tagged ten entities relevant to the domain: Court Name, Appellant Name, 
            Respondent Name, Judge Name, Counsel Appellant, Counsel Respondent, Citation, Section, Date of hearing, Date of judgement.
